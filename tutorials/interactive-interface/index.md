{:.notice}
This tutorial is tailored for anvi'o `v2.3.0` or later. You can learn the version of your installation by typing `anvi-interactive -v`. If you have an older version, some things will not work the way they should.

The purpose of this tutorial is to give you a brief idea about the capabilities of the anvi'o interactive interface using an intuitive dataset: the taxonomic profiles of 690 metagenomes from the [Human Microbiome Project](http://www.hmpdacc.org/) (HMP)) generated by [MetaPhlAn](http://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/metaphlan). To follow this tutorial create a new directory anywhere on your computer, and go into it from your terminal.

{:.notice}
While this tutorial will take you through a simple analysis of a real dataset, there also is available a more comprehensive (but more abstract) tutorial on [data types in the anvi'o interactive interface understands]({% post_url anvio/2016-02-27-the-anvio-interactive-interface %}){:target="_blank"}.

## The data matrix

We often represent our data in the following form:

||item_1|item_2|item_3|item_4|item_5|item_6|item_7|(...)|
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|sample_1|?|?|?|?|?|?|?|(...)|
|sample_2|?|?|?|?|?|?|?|(...)|
|sample_3|?|?|?|?|?|?|?|(...)|
|sample_4|?|?|?|?|?|?|?|(...)|
|sample_5|?|?|?|?|?|?|?|(...)|
|sample_6|?|?|?|?|?|?|?|(...)|
|sample_7|?|?|?|?|?|?|?|(...)|
|sample_8|?|?|?|?|?|?|?|(...)|
|sample_9|?|?|?|?|?|?|?|(...)|
|(...)|(...)|(...)|(...)|(...)|(...)|(...)|(...)|(...)|

The dataset we will go through in this tutorial is not different, and it follows the same structural organization:

|Metagenome|Streptococcus_mitis|Propionibacterium_acnes|Haemophilus_parainfluenzae|Lactobacillus_crispatus|Bacteroides_unclassified|Corynebacterium_matruchotii|(...)|
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|SRS011061|0|0|0.0375|0|0.5463|0|(...)|
|SRS011090|78.99923|0.01181|1.86651|0|0|0|(...)|
|SRS011098|1.03629|0.00202|3.1655|0|0.00442|10.7104|(...)|
|SRS011126|0.80909|0|8.07113|0|0.06489|21.49041|(...)|
|SRS011132|1.8407|75.61046|0.15936|0|0|0|(...)|
|SRS011134|0.20981|0|0.0731|0|14.23341|0|(...)|
|SRS011140|2.70361|0.00204|18.00913|0|0.0154|0.04016|(...)|
|SRS011144|32.22543|0.06306|3.622|0|0.03833|0.18776|(...)|
|SRS011152|1.50179|0|14.26581|0|0.01726|19.2156|(...)|
|(...)|(...)|(...)|(...)|(...)|(...)|(...)|(...)|

You can download the full dataset,

``` bash
 $ wget http://merenlab.org/tutorials/interactive-interface/files/data.txt
```

and you can take a very quick look at it in anvi'o:

``` bash
$ anvi-interactive -d data.txt \
                   -p profile.db \
                   --title "Taxonomic profiles of 690 gut metagenomes" \
                   --manual
```

[![manual](images/data-raw.png)](images/data-raw.png){:.center-img .width-50}

Because we haven't provided any specific organization, anvi'o organizes all samples alphabetically (very smart, anvi'o, really, thanks). But we will recover that.

{:.notice}
If you press `m` on your keyboard, you can toggle the information window on 


## Organizing items

Clearly there is not much to see in the previous display. Because we already know that those samples come from different environments (such as gut, and oral cavity), and they can be organized much better than sorting them alphabetically.

We can do a quick hierarchical clustering on the data using the program `anvi-matrix-to-newick `, and get back a newick "tree" that would make things a bit easier on our eyes:

``` bash
 $ anvi-matrix-to-newick data.txt \
                         -o tree.txt
```

``` bash
 $ anvi-interactive -d data.txt \
                    -p profile.db \
                    --title "Taxonomic profiles of 690 gut metagenomes" \
                    --tree tree.txt \
                    --manual
```

[![manual](images/data-w-tree.png)](images/data-w-tree.png){:.center-img .width-50}

A bit better! While we are here, though, click "save state" and save a default state so we don't have to press draw every time we run the interface going forward (later we will update that state). Although the program `anvi-matrix-to-newick` uses Euclidean distance and ward linkage by default to organize things, other distance metric and linkage options are available:

``` bash
 $ anvi-matrix-to-newick data.txt \
                         -o tree.txt \
                         --distance braycurtis \
                         --linkage average
```

{:.notice}
Available **distance metrics** include `braycurtis`, `canberra`, `chebyshev`, `cityblock`, `correlation`, `cosine`, `dice`, `euclidean`, `hamming`, `jaccard`, `kulsinski`, `matching`, `minkowski`, `rogerstanimoto`, `russellrao`, `sokalmichener`, `sokalsneath`, `sqeuclidean`, and `yule`. Available linkage algorithms include `single`, `complete`, `average`, `weighted`, `centroid`, `median`, and `ward`.

## Organizing layers

We definitely improved the organization of items based on their taxonomic makeup. But layers could have been organized better, as well. The initial step is somewhat similar (but notice that we now add the flag `--transpose`):

``` bash
 $ anvi-matrix-to-newick data.txt \
                         --transpose \
                         -o layers-tree.txt
```

Now we have a tree file to organize our layers, however, the utilization of this tree file will require a minimal understanding of what we call 'samples database' in anvi'o jargon. A rather comprehensive description of the samples database concept is laid out here:

[http://merenlab.org/2015/11/10/samples-db/](http://merenlab.org/2015/11/10/samples-db/)

If you read that, you already know about the sample-order file. If you don't want to spend time on it you can download it here:

``` bash
 $ wget http://merenlab.org/tutorials/interactive-interface/files/samples-order.txt
```

Now you can generate a samples database,

``` bash
 $ anvi-gen-samples-info-database -R samples-order.txt \
                                  -o samples.db
```

and re-run the `anvi-interactive`,

``` bash
 $ anvi-interactive -d data.txt \
                    -p profile.db \
                    --title "Taxonomic profiles of 690 gut metagenomes" \
                    --tree tree.txt \
                    -s samples.db \
                    --manual
```

You will be surprised to see that nothing has really changed. Why? Because you need to instruct anvi'o to use the new organization to order layers. This can be done from the "samples" tab (which clearly should be called 'layers' at this point):

[![manual](images/samples-org.png)](images/samples-org.png){:.center-img .width-90}

Then, if you click draw again, you will feel that we are getting somewhere.

## Going all corners

We are aware that most people have quite strong feelings against circular plots.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Strong feelings against circle plots? That&#39;s OK! You can have it the way you like interactively with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/anvio?src=hash">#anvio</a>: <a href="https://t.co/vynUkahdfK">https://t.co/vynUkahdfK</a> :) <a href="https://t.co/fL4ley5lT2">pic.twitter.com/fL4ley5lT2</a></p>&mdash; A. Murat Eren (@merenbey) <a href="https://twitter.com/merenbey/status/856521515516518400">April 24, 2017</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

We like them because they display more data in media we use for publishing (i.e., the A4 page size, etc). But as you probably know, anvi'o can also give you ugly, cornered displays (hehe).

To honor all those who like corners better, we shall continue with the phylogram display for the rest of this tutorial. When you change the "Drawing type" to phylogram, it will initially look quite ugly. But after playing with settings a little bit, you can make it look more reasonable:

[![manual](images/phylo.png)](images/phylo.png){:.center-img .width-80}


## Additional data for the items

Anvi'o can extend any view with additional data. For instance, we have some information about these metagenomes. Such as the sampling site, or the gender of the individual they originate from. We could display that information to improve our understanding of the data.

You can download the pre-prepared additional data file from here:

``` bash
 $ wget http://merenlab.org/tutorials/interactive-interface/files/additional-data.txt
```

The first column of the additional data file is pretty much identical to the data file, but there are some other data columns in it:

|Metagenome|Body_Site|Body_Subsite|Host_Gender|
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|SRS011061|GastrointestinalTract|Stool|Female|
|SRS011090|Oral|Buccal_mucosa|Female|
|SRS011098|Oral|Supragingival_plaque|Female|
|SRS011126|Oral|Supragingival_plaque|Male|
|SRS011132|Airways|Nares|Male|
|SRS011134|GastrointestinalTract|Stool|Male|
|SRS011140|Oral|Tongue_dorsum|Male|
|SRS011144|Oral|Buccal_mucosa|Male|
|SRS011152|Oral|Supragingival_plaque|Male|
|(...)|(...)|(...)|(...)|

Adding these additional information on an anvi'o display as new layers is quite straightforward:

``` bash
 $ anvi-interactive -d data.txt \
                    -p profile.db \
                    --title "Taxonomic profiles of 690 HMP metagenomes" \
                    --tree tree.txt \
                    -s samples.db \
                    -A additional-data.txt \
                    --manual
```

Just a small tip while we are here: you can always zoom-in to a particular part of a given display by making a selection while pressing your `shift` key:

![manual](images/zoom.gif){:.center-img .width-80}

## Additional data for the layers

How about extending layers with extra information? At this point we can at least add some taxonomy for these taxa. This information must be included in the samples database, just like the layers order information.

Here is one for the lazy:

``` bash
 $ wget http://merenlab.org/tutorials/interactive-interface/files/samples-information.txt
```

Now you can remove the old samples database, and generate a new one:

``` bash
 $ rm samples.db
 $ anvi-gen-samples-info-database -R samples-order.txt \
                                  -D samples-information.txt \
                                  -o samples.db
```

And rerun the interactive interface:

``` bash
 $ anvi-interactive -d data.txt \
                    -p profile.db \
                    --title "Taxonomic profiles of 690 HMP metagenomes" \
                    --tree tree.txt \
                    -s samples.db \
                    -A additional-data.txt \
                    --manual
```

to get this one:

[![manual](images/final-raw.png)](images/final-raw.png){:.center-img .width-80}

I guess we can all agree that this figure looks *unbearably* ugly, and quite useless :(

## Prettification

I had started this section by saying "prettification is clearly not a real word, but it absolutely should should have been". Then I Google'd it just for fun, and there it was! It *is* a real word, which means there is no reason for you to not do it:

[![manual](images/final-all.png)](images/final-all.png){:.center-img .width-80}

One of the most powerful aspects of anvi'o is its ability to give you so much power to communicate your results as best as possible.

Let's step by step prettify this display, to get this image:

[![manual](images/final-pretty.png)](images/final-pretty.png){:.center-img .width-80}

And this is the circular version:

[![manual](images/final-pretty-circle.png)](images/final-pretty-circle.png){:.center-img .width-60}

You can import this visual display into your version by downloading the anvi'o state file:

``` bash
 $ wget http://merenlab.org/tutorials/interactive-interface/files/pretty-state.json
 $ anvi-import-state -p PROFILE.db -s pretty-state.json -n default
```

Now you can re-run your interface, and you will have it, too:

``` bash
 $ anvi-interactive -d data.txt \
                    -p profile.db \
                    --title "Taxonomic profiles of 690 HMP metagenomes" \
                    --tree tree.txt \
                    -s samples.db \
                    -A additional-data.txt \
                    --manual
```
