{:.notice}
This tutorial is tailored for anvi'o `v2.0.1`. If you do not have this version available to you, certain things may not work the way they should.

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate some of the anvi'o capabilities using the Infant Gut dataset, which was generated, analyzed, and published by [Sharon et al. (2013)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22936250), and was re-analyzed in the [anvi'o methods paper](https://peerj.com/articles/1319/). If you are reading this tutorial, you are assumed to have access to the infant gut data pack, which contains some raw and intermediate metagenomic data from the infant gut dataset.

While this tutorial will take you through a simple analysis of a real dataset, you can access to a more comprehensive, yet more abstract tutorial [here]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-22-anvio-tutorial-v2 %}).

## BAM files and contigs FASTA for the Infant Gut data

In the directory `00_BAM_FILES_AND_CONTIGS` you will find the the the co-assembly of the time series data, `contigs.fa`, and an indexed BAM file for each sampling day. These BAM files were generated by mapping metagenomic short reads from each sample to `contigs.fa`.

{:.notice}
Dear ECOGEO people, you will be missing this directory in your data pack due to size considerations for the virtual machine.

Anvi'o metagenomic workflow [starts with BAM files and a FASTA file]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-22-anvio-tutorial-v2 %}#preparation) for your contigs. There are many ways to get your contigs and BAM files for your metagenomes. But we have started implementing a tutorial that describes the workflow _we_ use to generate these files regularly: "[A tutorial on assembly-based metagenomics]({{ site.url }}/tutorials/assembly-based-metagenomics/)". Please feel free to take a look at that one, as well.

## The merged profile

The directory `01_ANVIO_MERGED_PROFILE` contains the anvi'o contigs database that is generated from `contigs.fa`, and the anvi'o merged profile, which is generated by merging individual anvi'o profiles for each of the BAM file in `00_BAM_FILES_AND_CONTIG`.

{:.notice}
Want to learn more? Here are some direct links: [generating an anvi'o contigs database]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-22-anvio-tutorial-v2 %}#creating-an-anvio-contigs-database), [profiling BAM files]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-22-anvio-tutorial-v2 %}#profiling-bam-files), and [merging anvi'o profiles]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-22-anvio-tutorial-v2 %}#working-with-anvio-profiles)

If you go into that directory,

{% highlight bash %}
 $ cd 01_ANVIO_MERGED_PROFILE/
{% endhighlight %}

and execute the `anvi-interactive` command on these files,

{% highlight bash %}
 $ anvi-interactive -p PROFILE.db -c CONTIGS.db 
{% endhighlight %}

Once the interactive interface is up and running, you can start binning:

[![Infant gut merged](images/infant-gut-merged.gif)](images/infant-gut-merged.gif){:.center-img .width-50}


When you are tired of the interactive interface, you can go back to the terminal and press `CTRL + C` to kill the server.

## Importing taxonomy

[Centrifuge](https://github.com/infphilo/centrifuge) is [one of the options]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-18-importing-taxonomy %}#centrifuge-output) to [import taxonomic annotations]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-18-importing-taxonomy %}) into an anvi'o contigs database. Files for the infant gut data are already in the directory `02_CENTRIFUGE_FILES`.

If you import these files into the contigs database the following way,

{% highlight bash %}
 $ anvi-import-taxonomy -c CONTIGS.db -i ../02_CENTRIFUGE_FILES/*.tsv -p centrifuge 
{% endhighlight %}

And run the interactive again,

{% highlight bash %}
 $ anvi-interactive -p PROFILE.db -c CONTIGS.db 
{% endhighlight %}

You will see an additional layer with taxonomy:

{:.notice}
In the Layers tab find the `Taxonomy` layer, set its height to `200`, and click `Draw` again. Then click `Save State` button, and overwrite the `default` state. This will make sure anvi'o remembers to make the height of that layer 200px the next time you run the interactive interface!

## Binning

### External binning results

The directory `03_EXTERNAL_BINNING_RESULTS` contains number of files describe the binning of contigs in the infant gut data based on various binning approaches:

* [GROOPM.txt](files/GROOPM.txt)
* [METABAT.txt](files/METABAT.txt)
* [MAXBIN.txt](files/MAXBIN.txt)
* [CONCOCT.txt](files/CONCOCT.txt)
* [SHARON_et_al.txt](files/SHARON_et_al.txt)

The first three files are courtesy of Elaina Graham, who used [GroopM](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4183954/) (v0.3.5), [MetaBat](https://peerj.com/articles/1165/) (v0.26.3), and [MaxBin](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2049-2618-2-26) (v2.1.1) to bin contigs using BAM files and the contigs FASTA in `01_ANVIO_MERGED_PROFILE`. For future references, here are the parameters Elaina used for each approach:

{% highlight bash %}
 # GroopM v0.3.5 (followed the general workflow on their manual)
 $ groopm parse groopm.db contigs.fa [list of bam files]
 $ groopm core groopm.db -c 1000 -s 10 -b 1000000
 $ groopm recruit groopm.db -c 500 -s 200
 $ groopm extract groopm.db contigs.fa 

 # MetaBat v0.26.3 (used jgi_summarize_bam_contig_depths to get a depth file from BAM files).
 $ metabat -i contigs.fa -a depth.txt -o bin

 # MaxBin v2.1.1
 $ run_MaxBin.pl -contig contigs.fa -out maxbin_IGM -abund_list [list of all coverage files in associated format]
{% endhighlight %}

[CONCOCT](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n11/full/nmeth.3103.html) results come from the CONCOCT module embedded within anvi'o. 

Finally, I generated Sharon et al. results by BLAST searching sequences in bins identified by the authors of the study (see [http://ggkbase.berkeley.edu/carrol](http://ggkbase.berkeley.edu/carrol)) to our contigs to have matching names.

OK. Moving on.

### Comparing binning results

You can import a file that describes the results of an external binning effort into your profile database, and see how they group contigs. For instance, let's import the CONCOCT collection:

{% highlight bash %}
 $ anvi-import-collection -c CONTIGS.db -p PROFILE.db -C CONCOCT --contigs-mode ../03_EXTERNAL_BINNING_RESULTS/CONCOCT.txt
{% endhighlight %}

And run the interactive again,

{% highlight bash %}
 $ anvi-interactive -p PROFILE.db -c CONTIGS.db 
{% endhighlight %}

Once the display is ready, click `Bins > Load bin collection > CONCOCT > Load`.

[![Infant gut merged](images/infant-gut-concoct.png)](images/infant-gut-concoct.png){:.center-img .width-50}

So far so good.

But since we have all these results from different binning approaches, it clearly would have been interesting to compare them to each other (because [benchmarking stuff]({% post_url anvio/2015-06-23-comparing-different-mapping-software %}) is often very insightful, especially when everything about metagenomics is very complex).

To compare binning results, we could import each external binning result into the profile database the way we imported CONCOCT. But unfortunately at any given time there could only be one bin collection can be displayed in the interface. Fortunately there are other things we can do. For instance, as a workaround we can merge all binning results into a single file, and use that file as an 'additional data file'.

I implemented a little program, [`anvi-script-merge-collections`](files/anvi-script-merge-collections), to merge multiple collections into a single TAB-delimited file. If you download it,

{% highlight bash %}
 $ wget http://merenlab.org/tutorials/infant-gut/files/anvi-script-merge-collections
{% endhighlight %}

And use it the following way,

{% highlight bash %}
 $ python anvi-script-merge-collections -c CONTIGS.db -i ../03_EXTERNAL_BINNING_RESULTS/*.txt -o collections.tsv
{% endhighlight %}

You can run the interactive interface to display all collections of bins stored in `collections.tsv` as additional layers,

{% highlight bash %}
 $ anvi-interactive -p PROFILE.db -c CONTIGS.db -A collections.tsv
{% endhighlight %}

And you would get a display similar to this (after setting the height of each additional layer to 200px):

[![Infant gut merged](images/infant-gut-collections.png)](images/infant-gut-collections.png){:.center-img .width-50}

To make thinks a little more visually related, I created an anvi'o states file, `states.json`, and wrote a program, `anvi-import-state`, to import it into your profile database. If you download these files and run them the following way, 

{% highlight bash %}
 $ wget http://merenlab.org/tutorials/infant-gut/files/anvi-import-state
 $ wget http://merenlab.org/tutorials/infant-gut/files/state.json
 $ python anvi-import-state --state state.json --name default -p PROFILE.db
{% endhighlight %}

And run the interactive interface again,

{% highlight bash %}
 $ anvi-interactive -p PROFILE.db -c CONTIGS.db -A collections.tsv
{% endhighlight %}

This time you will get this display:

[![Infant gut merged](images/infant-gut-collections-final.png)](images/infant-gut-collections-final.png){:.center-img .width-50}

Let's also import the collection we published in the [anvi'o methods paper](https://peerj.com/articles/1319/) with the proper colors:

{% highlight bash %}
 $ wget http://merenlab.org/tutorials/infant-gut/files/merens.txt
 $ wget http://merenlab.org/tutorials/infant-gut/files/merens-info.txt
 $ anvi-import-collection merens.txt -p PROFILE.db -c CONTIGS.db -C merens --bins-info merens-info.txt
{% endhighlight %}

Now you can rerun the interactive interface, and click `Bins > Load bin collection > merens > Load` to display our collection in comparison:

[![Infant gut merged](images/infant-gut-collections-final-w-merens.png)](images/infant-gut-collections-final-w-merens.png){:.center-img .width-50}

Much better! Now we can discuss about the efficacy of different approaches, and investigate the taxonomy of contigs where methods disagree:
