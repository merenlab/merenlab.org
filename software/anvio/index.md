# Anvi'o: integrated multi-omics at scale

<a href="/software/anvio/network/" target="_blank"><img src="/images/anvio-network.png" width="100%" /></a>

Anvi'o is an **[open-source](http://github.com/meren/anvio)**, **community-driven** analysis and visualization platform for **microbial 'omics**. It brings together many aspects of today's cutting-edge strategies including **genomics**, **metagenomics**, **metatranscriptomics**, **pangenomics**, **metapangenomics**, **phylogenomics**, and **microbial population genetics** in an *integrated* and *easy-to-use* fashion through extensive **interactive visualization** capabilities.

Anvi'o currently stands on **more than 80,000 lines of Python and JavaScript code** that follow modern software development paradigms thanks to the voluntary contributions of **more than [30 developers](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt)** from the academia and industry, [empowering microbiologists](/testimonials/) for their [complex needs](https://github.com/merenlab/anvio/releases) through an architecture that [enables reproducible science](http://merenlab.org/2016/11/21/bacteroides-genome-variants/) and simple interfaces for data access.

As a principle, anvi'o does not track its users by any means, but based on [self-reported data on Twitter](https://twitter.com/merenbey/status/1218364014641786882), there is at least one anvi'o user in the following countries:
