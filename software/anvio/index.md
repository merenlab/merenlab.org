# Anvi'o in a nutshell

Anvi'o is an analysis and visualization platform for 'omics data. It brings together many aspects of today's cutting-edge genomic, metagenomic, and metatranscriptomic analysis practices to address a wide array of needs.

Please see the "**Tutorials**" pull-down menu on this page for some example workflows with anvi'o. Anvi'o is a community-driven, GPL-licensed open-source project. You can browse its codebase by clicking [here](http://github.com/meren/anvio), and you can find our methods paper for anvi'o by clicking [here](https://peerj.com/articles/1319/).

If you are at the ISME Conference, please visit our poster on Thursday at **#387B**!

Anvi'o would not have been possible without the help of many people who directly or indirectly contributed to its development. Here is the acknowledgements section of our [methods paper](https://peerj.com/articles/1319/), where we had the chance to name some of the individuals who helped us:
