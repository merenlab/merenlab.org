The flagship anvi&#x27;o proram to profile a BAM file. Running this program on a BAM file will quantify coverages per nucleotide position in read recruitment results and will average coverage and detection data per contig. It will also calculate single-nucleotide, single-codon, and single-amino acid variants, as well as structural variants, such as insertion and deletions, to eventually stores all data into a single anvi&#x27;o profile database. For very large projects, this program can demand a lot of time, memory, and storage resources. If all you want is to learn coverages of your nutleotides, genes, contigs, or your bins collections from BAM files very rapidly, and/or you do not need anvi&#x27;o single profile databases for your project, please see other anvi&#x27;o programs that profile BAM files, `anvi-script-get-coverage-from-bam` and `anvi-profile-blitz`.

## Usage


This program **creates a <span class="artifact-n">[single-profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/single-profile-db)</span> from a <span class="artifact-n">[bam-file](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/bam-file)</span> and <span class="artifact-n">[contigs-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/contigs-db)</span>**. 

Once you have a <span class="artifact-n">[single-profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/single-profile-db)</span>, you can run programs like <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-cluster-contigs](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-cluster-contigs)</span>, <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-estimate-metabolism](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-estimate-metabolism)</span>, and <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-gen-gene-level-stats-databases](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-gen-gene-level-stats-databases)</span>, as well as use the interactive interface with <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-interactive](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-interactive)</span>. If you want to run these same contigs against multiple BAM files (because you have multiple samples), you'll combine your <span class="artifact-n">[single-profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/single-profile-db)</span>s into a <span class="artifact-n">[profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/profile-db)</span> after you've created them all using <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-merge](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-merge)</span>. See the pages for <span class="artifact-n">[single-profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/single-profile-db)</span> or <span class="artifact-n">[profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/profile-db)</span> for more you can do with these artifacts. 

In short, this program runs various analyses on the contigs in your <span class="artifact-n">[contigs-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/contigs-db)</span> and how they relate to the sample information stored in the <span class="artifact-n">[bam-file](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/bam-file)</span> you provided. It then stores this information into a <span class="artifact-n">[single-profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/single-profile-db)</span>. Specifically, this program calculates 
* coverage per nucleotide position (if you're unsure what coverage refers to, check out [this page](http://merenlab.org/vocabulary/#coverage))
* single-nucleotide, single-codon, and single-amino acid variants (You can find all of those terms on the vocab page linked above, as well as a more detailed explaination [here](http://merenlab.org/2015/07/20/analyzing-variability/#an-intro-to-single-nucleotidecodonamino-acid-variation))
* structural variants such as insertions or deletions 

## Basic Usage

### Inputs 

This program takes in an [indexed](https://merenlab.org/software/anvio/help/programs/anvi-init-bam) <span class="artifact-n">[bam-file](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/bam-file)</span> and a <span class="artifact-n">[contigs-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/contigs-db)</span>. The BAM file contains the short reads from a single sample that will be used to create the profile database. Thus, here is a standard run with default parameters: 

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;profile &#45;i <span class="artifact&#45;n">[bam&#45;file](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/bam&#45;file)</span> \
             &#45;c <span class="artifact&#45;n">[contigs&#45;db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/contigs&#45;db)</span> 
</div>

Alternatively, if you lack mapping data, you can add the flag `--blank-profile` so that you can still get the functionality of a profile database. 

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;profile &#45;c <span class="artifact&#45;n">[contigs&#45;db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/contigs&#45;db)</span>  \ 
            &#45;&#45;blank&#45;profile
</div>

### Checking your BAM file: always a good idea 

If you want to first check your BAM file to see what contigs it contains, just use the flag `--list-contigs` to see a comprehensive list. 

### Profiling a subset of contigs

*Note: This describes how to profile a named subset of contigs. To profile a subset of contigs based on their characterists (for example, only contigs of a certain length or that have a certain coverage), see the section below on "contig specifications"*

By default, anvi'o will use every contig in your <span class="artifact-n">[contigs-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/contigs-db)</span>. However, if you wish to focus specifically on a subset of these contigs, just provide a file that contains only the names of the contigs you want to analyze, one per line, using the tag `--contigs-of-interest`.

For example, you could run

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;profile &#45;c Ross_sea_contigs.db  \ 
             &#45;&#45;blank&#45;profile \
             &#45;&#45;contigs&#45;of&#45;interest contigs_i_like.txt
</div>

Where `contigs_i_like.txt` looks like this: 

    SF15-RossSeacontig4922
    SF15-RossSeacontig702

## Analysis Parameters
 
Changing these will affect the way that your sequences are analyzed. 

Keep in mind that if you plan to merge your resulting <span class="artifact-n">[single-profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/single-profile-db)</span> with others later in the project, you'll want to keep these parameters consistent. 

### Contig Specification 

To profile only contigs within a specific length, you can use the flags `--min-contig-length` and `-max-contig-length`. By default, the minimum length for analysis is 1000 and there is no maximum length. You can also profile only contigs that have a certain average coverage with the flag `--min-mean-coverage`. 

#### Specifications for your BAM file

You can also ignore reads in your BAM file with a percent identity to the reference less than some threshold using the flag `--min-percent-identity`.  By default, all reads are used. 

For example, the following code will only look at contigs longer than 2000 nts and will ignore BAM file reads with less than 95 percent identity to the reference:

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;profile &#45;c Ross_sea_contigs.db  \ 
            &#45;i bam_file.bam \
            &#45;&#45;min&#45;contig&#45;length 2000 \
            &#45;&#45;min&#45;percent&#45;identity 95 
</div>

### Hierarchical Clustering 

#### To cluster or not to cluster? 

By default, anvi'o will not try to cluster your splits (since it takes quite a bit of runtime) unless you are using the tag `--blank-profile`. If you don't want to run this, use the tag `--skip-hierarchical-clustering`. 

If you're planning to later merge this sample with others, it is better to perform clustering while running <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-merge](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-merge)</span> than at this stage. 

However, if you want to bin this single sample or otherwise want clustering to happen, just use the tag `--cluster-contigs`. 

If you do plan to cluster, you can set a custom distance metric or a custom linkage method. 

### Variability 

Anvi-profile will throw away variability data below certain thresholds to reduce noise. After all, if you have a single C read at a position with a 1000X coverage where all other reads are T, this is probably not a variant position that you want to investigate further. By default, it will not analyze positions with coverage less than 10X, and it will further discard variants based on [this criteria](https://merenlab.org/2015/07/20/analyzing-variability/#de-novo-characterization-and-reporting-of-snvs). 

However, you can change the coverage threshold using the  `--min-coverage-for-variability` flag. You can also report every variability position using the flag `--report-variability-full`. 

For example, if you wanted to view every variant, you would profile with the following:

<div class="codeblock" markdown="1">
anvi&#45;profile &#45;c Ross_sea_contigs.db  \ 
            &#45;i bam_file.bam \
            &#45;&#45;min&#45;coverage&#45;for&#45;variability 1 \
            &#45;&#45;report&#45;variability&#45;full
</div>

## Other Parameters 

You should provide the sample name with the flag `-S` and can provide a description of your project using the `--description` tag followed by a text file. These will help anvi'o name output files and will show up in the anvi'o interfaces down the line. 

You can characterize the codon frequencies of genes in your sample at the cost of some runtime. Despite time being money, codon frequency analysis can be helpful downstream. Simply add the tag `--profile-SCVs` and watch the magic happen.

{:.notice}
If you have prior experience with `--profile-SCVs` being slow, you will be surprised how fast it is
since v6.2

Alternatively, you can choose not to store insertion and deletion data or single nucleotide variant data.

If you know the limits of your system, you can also multithread this program. See the program help menu for more information.
