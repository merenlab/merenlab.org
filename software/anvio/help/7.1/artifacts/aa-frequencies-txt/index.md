## Required or used by


There are no anvi'o tools that use or require this artifact directly, which means it is most likely an end-product for the user.


## Description

This file contains **the frequency of each amino acid for some reference context in your <span class="artifact-n">[contigs-db](/software/anvio/help/main/artifacts/contigs-db)</span>**.  

This is a tab-delimited table where each column represents an amino acid and each row represents a specific reference context (most often this will be a gene after running <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-get-codon-frequencies](/software/anvio/help/main/programs/anvi-get-codon-frequencies)</span>). The numbers will either refer to counts of each amino acid or precent normalizations depending on the parameters with which you ran <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-get-codon-frequencies](/software/anvio/help/main/programs/anvi-get-codon-frequencies)</span>. 

You can also use <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-get-aa-counts](/software/anvio/help/main/programs/anvi-get-aa-counts)</span> to get this information for a <span class="artifact-n">[bin](/software/anvio/help/main/artifacts/bin)</span>, <span class="artifact-n">[collection](/software/anvio/help/main/artifacts/collection)</span>, or <span class="artifact-n">[splits-txt](/software/anvio/help/main/artifacts/splits-txt)</span>.
