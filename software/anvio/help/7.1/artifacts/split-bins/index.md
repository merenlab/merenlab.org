## Provided by

## Description

This is the result of <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-split](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-split)</span>: self-contained anvi'o projects that contain just the contents of a single <span class="artifact-n">[bin](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/bin)</span> from your original database. 

This describes a directory that either contains either a <span class="artifact-n">[genomes-storage-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/genomes-storage-db)</span> and <span class="artifact-n">[pan-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/pan-db)</span> (if that's what you gave <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-split](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-split)</span> as an input) or a <span class="artifact-n">[profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/profile-db)</span> and <span class="artifact-n">[contigs-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/contigs-db)</span> pair. The contigs or genomes and gene clusters described in these databases will be only those contained in the bin that the directory's name corresponds to.
