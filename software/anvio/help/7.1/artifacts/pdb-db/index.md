## Description


## What is this thing?  

This is a comprehensive database of protein structures downloaded from the PDB RSCB that are non-redundant. Currently, it is used for those who want to run <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-gen-structure-database](/software/anvio/help/main/programs/anvi-gen-structure-database)</span> without an internet connection.


## Where does it come from?  

A <span class="artifact-n">[pdb-db](/software/anvio/help/main/artifacts/pdb-db)</span> can be created via the program <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-setup-pdb-database](/software/anvio/help/main/programs/anvi-setup-pdb-database)</span>. Alternatively, a <span class="artifact-n">[pdb-db](/software/anvio/help/main/artifacts/pdb-db)</span> that contains custom structures not found in the [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) can in theory be generated by the user, but anvi'o currrently offers no reasonable way of doing this.


## Notes 

The <span class="artifact-n">[pdb-db](/software/anvio/help/main/artifacts/pdb-db)</span> generated via <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-setup-pdb-database](/software/anvio/help/main/programs/anvi-setup-pdb-database)</span> is ~20GB.
