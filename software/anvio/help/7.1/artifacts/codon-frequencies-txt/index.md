A TXT-type anvi'o artifact. This artifact is typically generated, used, and/or exported **by anvi'o** (and not provided by the user)..

## Provided by


<p style="text-align: left" markdown="1"><span class="artifact-p">[anvi-get-codon-frequencies](../../programs/anvi-get-codon-frequencies)</span></p>


## Required or used by


There are no anvi'o tools that use or require this artifact directly, which means it is most likely an end-product for the user.


## Description

This file contains **the frequency of each codon in each gene in your <span class="artifact-n">[contigs-db](/software/anvio/help/main/artifacts/contigs-db)</span>.** 

This is a tab-delimited table where each column represents a codon and each row represents a specific gene. The numbers will either refer to counts of each codon or precent normalizations depending on the parameters with which you ran <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-get-codon-frequencies](/software/anvio/help/main/programs/anvi-get-codon-frequencies)</span>. 

### Example

    gene_caller_id  GCA GCC GCG GCT ...
