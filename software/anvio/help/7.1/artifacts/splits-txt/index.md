## Description

This is a **text file containing a list of splits**. 

This file has only one column with one split name per line. For example 

    split_name_1
    split_name_2
    split_name_3
    
    
This kind of file is used when you want to focus your analysis on only a specific set of splits. Just provide one of these and the program will only look at `split_name_1`, `split_name_2`, and `split_name_3`.
