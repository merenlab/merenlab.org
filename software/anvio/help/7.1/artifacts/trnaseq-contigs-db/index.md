## Description

A tRNA-seq contigs database is a **<span class="artifact-n">[contigs-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/contigs-db)</span> variant containing information on tRNA transcripts identified from tRNA-seq experiments**.

This database is created by the program, <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-merge-trnaseq](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-merge-trnaseq)</span>, which is part of the <span class="artifact-n">[trnaseq-workflow](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/trnaseq-workflow)</span>. This program also creates <span class="artifact-n">[trnaseq-profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/trnaseq-profile-db)</span>s. <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-run-trna-taxonomy](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-run-trna-taxonomy)</span> populates the tRNA-seq contigs database with taxonomic annotations.

This database functions in a manner equivalent to the normal metagenomic-style contigs database. As normal contigs databases are associated with a normal <span class="artifact-n">[profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/profile-db)</span> containing coverage-related data, tRNA-seq contigs databases are associated with <span class="artifact-n">[trnaseq-profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/trnaseq-profile-db)</span>s. The name can be misleading: tRNA-seq contigs databases do not contain information on assembled contigs as such. Rather, the fundamental type of sequence reconstructed from a tRNA-seq experiment is a **tRNA seed**, representing a mature tRNA sequence (minus the 3'-CCA acceptor) found in one or more samples in the experiment. tRNA seeds are not predicted by assembly at all, but by the specialized software of <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-trnaseq](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-trnaseq)</span> and <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-merge-trnaseq](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-merge-trnaseq)</span>.

A variety of information on tRNA seeds is contained in a tRNA-seq contigs database, including structural profiles, taxonomic annotations, and user-defined bins.

## Uses

Tabulation of tRNA-seq data by <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-tabulate-trnaseq](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-tabulate-trnaseq)</span> requires a tRNA-seq contigs database and <span class="artifact-n">[trnaseq-profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/trnaseq-profile-db)</span>.

Interactive visualization of tRNA-seq datasets in <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-interactive](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-interactive)</span> requires this database and a <span class="artifact-n">[trnaseq-profile-db](/software/anvio/help/7.1/artifacts/trnaseq-profile-db)</span>.

Visualization of grouped seeds by <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-plot-trnaseq](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-plot-trnaseq)</span> requires this database in addition to files produced by <span class="artifact-n">[anvi-tabulate-trnaseq](/software/anvio/help/7.1/programs/anvi-tabulate-trnaseq)</span>.
