Export split or contig sequences and coverages across samples stored in an anvi&#39;o profile database. This program is especially useful if you would like to &#39;bin&#39; your splits or contigs outside of anvi&#39;o and import the binning results into anvi&#39;o using `anvi-import-collection` program.
