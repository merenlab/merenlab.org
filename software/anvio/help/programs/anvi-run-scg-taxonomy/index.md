The purpose of this program is to affiliate single-copy core genes in an anvi&#39;o contigs database with taxonomic names. A properly setup local SCG taxonomy database is required for this program to perform properly. After its successful run, `anvi-estimate-scg-taxonomy` will be useful to estimate taxonomy at genome-, collection-, or metagenome-level).
