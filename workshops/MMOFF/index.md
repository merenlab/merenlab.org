## About the Workshop
How can we maximize current and future opportunities in marine microbial observation? The microbial world, though invisible to the naked eye, is central to human sustenance and the health of our planet, underpinning critical ecosystem services and contributing to climate stability. As we look to the future, omics-powered marine microbial observatories are poised to further increase in importance for understanding the complex dynamics of ocean ecosystems, offering insights that can, inter alia, help track ocean heatlth and biodiversity loss, detect early signals of ecosystem tipping points, support biotechnical innovation, inform sustainable environmental management, and guide marine policy and conservation. However, to fully realize this potential, key aspects of the current observing system must strategically evolve. 

_Marine Microbial Observatories for the Future: From Samples to Data to Legacy Using Integrated 'Omics Strategies_ is a two-day workshop, aimed at laying the groundwork for a lasting legacy of microbial observations in the ocean.

As part of ongoing international efforts to advance 'omics-based observing of marine biodiversity, this workshop responds to a growing need to ensure that microbial observations, samples, and data are not only scientifically robust but also sustainable, reusable, and policy-relevant over time.

The workshop brings together a multidisciplinary group of experts in:

* Environmental metagenomics
* Time-series & ship-based ocean observations
* Global coordination networks
* Data users
* Data and sample management
* Policy and governance
* Publishing

Together, we will:

* Identify key challenges in observing marine microbes using 'omics approaches
* Facilitate the exchange of lessons learned across observing efforts
* Develop strategies and solutions for long-term coordination and impact

An expected outcome of the workshop is a synthesis paper that distills these discussions and outlines a collective vision for the future of microbial ocean observing.
