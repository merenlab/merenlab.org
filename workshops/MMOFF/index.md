## About the Workshop
How can we maximize current and future opportunities in marine microbial observation? The microbial world, though invisible to the naked eye, is central to human sustenance and the health of our planet, underpinning critical ecosystem services and contributing to climate stability. As we look to the future, omics-powered marine microbial observatories are poised to further increase in importance for understanding the complex dynamics of ocean ecosystems, offering insights that can, inter alia, help track ocean health and biodiversity loss, detect early signals of ecosystem tipping points, support biotechnical innovation, inform sustainable environmental management, and guide marine policy and conservation. However, to fully realize this potential, key aspects of the current observing system must strategically evolve. 

_Marine Microbial Observatories for the Future: From Samples to Data to Legacy Using Integrated 'Omics Strategies_ is a two-day workshop, aimed at laying the groundwork for a lasting legacy of microbial observations in the ocean.

As part of ongoing international efforts to advance 'omics-based observing of marine biodiversity, this workshop responds to a growing need to ensure that microbial observations, samples, and data are not only scientifically robust but also sustainable, reusable, and policy-relevant over time.

The workshop brings together a multidisciplinary group of experts in:

* Environmental metagenomics
* Time-series & ship-based ocean observations
* Global coordination networks
* Data users
* Data and sample management
* Policy and governance
* Publishing

Together, we will:

* Identify key challenges in observing marine microbes using 'omics approaches
* Facilitate the exchange of lessons learned across observing efforts
* Develop strategies and solutions for long-term coordination and impact

An expected outcome of the workshop is a synthesis paper that distills these discussions and outlines a collective vision for the future of microbial ocean observing.

Thomas Stjernegaard-Jeppesen is a Fullstack JavaScript developer at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) in Denmark. Thomas is interested in improving the accessibility and interoperability of DNA-derived data through global biodiversity data platforms. [His work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ojLBbjAAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao) bridges biodiversity informatics and molecular data publishing, with a focus on enabling the integration of genetic data into systems like GBIF. We invited Thomas to bring expertise from the biodiversity data publishing world and to support alignment between omics communities and global data infrastructures.

Tobias Guldberg Frøslev is a Scientific Officer at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and an Associate Professor at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. Tobias is interested in making metabarcoding data more discoverable and FAIR through global biodiversity infrastructure. With a [background in molecular ecology and mycology](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3RjyxAoAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao), he works to connect research-driven DNA sequencing with biodiversity data standards and publication pipelines as part of GBIF’s [Metabarcoding Data Programme](https://www.gbif.org/metabarcoding). We invited Tobias for his expertise in linking molecular ecology with data infrastructure and his role in shaping how DNA-derived biodiversity data are shared at scale.

Yosmina Tapilatu is a Senior Research Scientist at the National Research and Innovation Agency in Indonesia. Yosmina is interested in marine biodiversity of Maluku Archipelago, ranging from bacteria to invertebrates. Besides her [extensive body of work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ixjeJVIAAAAJ&hl=de&oi=ao) that spans deep-sea ecology and hydrocarbonoclastic prokaryotes, you may know Yosmina from her involvement in regional coordination efforts and in the [Association of Tropical Biology and Conservation](https://tropicalbiology.org), as well as from her role as Deep-Ocean Strategy Ambassadors. We invited Yosmina because of her expertise in deep-sea microbial ecology, her involvement in Indonesian observing efforts, and the regional perspective she brings for marine microbial observing in Indonesia.
