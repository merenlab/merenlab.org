  notes: "A large proportion of the logistics of Steve's visit was coordinated by the Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg (HWK), an independent institute for advanced study and a non-profit foundation. We are extremely lucky in Oldenburg that such an institute exists and supports international collaborators who wish to visit a lab in the region. If you are thinking about coming here for a sabbatical or a for a few months of research stay, please consider visiting the <a id='aff-link' target='_blank' href='https://hanse-ias.de/en/'>HWK web page</a>"
