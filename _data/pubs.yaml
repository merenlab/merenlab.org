        - "Two groups of genetically identical mice with different microbial community structures differ in their response to skin transplants from genetically identical sources: one group rejects the skin faster than the other."
        - Transferring poop from slow-rejecting mice into fast-rejecting mice turns fast-rejecting mice into slow-rejecting mice.
        - These suggest that differences in 'resident microbiome' in healthy individuals <i>may</i> contribute to interpersonal variability in graft outcomes, and fecal microbiota transplantation <i>may</i> play a therapeutic role to reverse that phenotype.
        - Basically, "we do not have a mechanistic understanding, but this is definitely very interesting".
