There is no clear "*take home message*" in this post. But if you are in the mood for some serious procrastination, please go ahead and read it at your own risk. You will find some insights into a metagenomic dataset, and at the end you may end up finding yourself inspired to look into the details of your own metagenomes in similar ways.

The reason there is no clear take home message is probably because even the simplest meatgenome is too complex to make *complete* sense of it. This is partially due to the complexity of microbial life really, but the rest of it is just the noise and bias we introduce way before we start seeing figures from our data. Even a single thread of questioning that involves a fraction of the picture can go too deep to reach its end in a reasonable amount of time and effort. I think that's what happened here as well, and I believe this post will provide a glimpse into that, too.

I always see people who write well start their pieces with an insightful and fitting quote from an inspirational person. So here is mine:

<blockquote>
No one will read your stupid blog post, and you are wasting your time with this data, Meren.

</blockquote>


## Background

Everything started when this paper appeared in Nature:

* [Complete nitrification by a single microorganism](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vnfv/ncurrent/full/nature16459.html)

The story is quite a fascinating one even if you are not a microbiologist, and the claim is pretty grand. So clearly we wanted to take a look at the data .. you know, for the sake of science. However, it quickly became clear that the authors did not make any of the raw data available. This is a very disturbing issue that I keep running into. Think about how many people a study has to pass without any raw data before it gets published in a journal. I vocalized my frustration without expecting anything in return:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" lang="en" style="width: 100%;"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can&#39;t believe there is no raw data for the complete nitrification paper. <a href="https://twitter.com/nature">@Nature</a>, how do your reviewers even review these submissions?</p>&mdash; A. Murat Eren (@merenbey) <a href="https://twitter.com/merenbey/status/670319871666872320">November 27, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

But in return, I heard from [Michael Wagner](http://www.microbial-ecology.net/), the senior and corresponding author of another study on the same subject with a very similar title, which was even to appear in the same issue of Nature:

* [Complete nitrification by *Nitrospira* bacteria](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vnfv/ncurrent/full/nature16461.html)

Wagner's group *did* report the raw data, as well as the genome they recovered from their enrichments. It should be the standard, but unfortunately it is almost a surprise to see science being done the way it is supposed to.

###  A word for editors and reviewers

Before I continue with the data, I would like to have a monologue with all the confused editors and reviewers out there who forgot that science is all about reproducibility.

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/raw-data.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/raw-data.png" width="40%" /></a>
</div>

If you are an editor, and don't see a "data availability" section in a manuscript, do science a favor and **don't send it out for review**. If you are a reviewer who is asked to review a paper without any reported raw data, **don't review it**, and send back an immediate correspondence to the editor to remind them that what they sent out for review is better classified as fiction in its current form. Yes, you may not have the time, the expertise, or the interest to go through all the data to make sure the critical claims in the manuscript are safe and sound. But if you at least pursue the authors to make their raw data available together with their manuscript, the community can identify if there is an outstanding problem. [Here is a paper](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002541) that was not properly reviewed, and [here is a review](http://bib.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/05/22/bib.bbt010.full) that was done by the community to fix the error. So this really works when you don't shoot us in the foot by not making sure the raw data is published.

So, do your job.

OK.

The study done by Wagner's group is a very elaborate one. If you have read the paper, this post probably will make more sense to you, but if you didn't, here is a quick and unfair recap of what they did:

* They sampled a microbial biofilm from a pipe used in a deep oil exploration well.
* They incubated the sample in specific conditions to enrich the ammonia-oxidizing microbes.
* After a series of subcultivation steps, they obtained 'ENR4', an enrichment culture that oxidizes ammonia to nitrate with lots of Nitrospira without any other detectable nitrifiers, plus multiple other bacterial populations.
* After more subcultivation steps, they obtained 'ENR6', which also oxidizes ammonia to nitrate, and in contrast to 'ENR4', this one contains only Nitrospira and one other bacterial population. These enrichment steps took 4 years!
* Thanks to the overall simplicity of these communities, deep sequencing, and the critical use of MinION, they recovered the complete genome of a Nitrospira population, and they named it -quite thoughtfully- "*Candidatus* Nitrospira inopinata".
* And they characterized the key nitrification loci in this genome:

</div>

Overall, there is nothing alarming with their analyses, and if you are one of those skeptics and looking for external validation, please feel free to add my 2 cents into the the list of people who are pleased with this study.

That being said, there *are* some interesting things about this genome that puzzled me.

In the following sections I will write about my journey in this dataset while I will point out things that I couldn't fully answer. As I will jump from one random thing to another, I hope the reader will be inspired by the potential uses of the platform we are working on, and see how easily one can go after challenging questions with it. If you don't have much experience with metagenomes, you may also appreciate the challenges of working with metagenomic data (especially if you want to be meticulous).

I used the v2 clade of anvi'o for all these analyses, which is not available as a stable distribution yet, but you still can install it through [our github repository](https://github.com/meren/anvio/) following the [installation instructions]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-26-installation-v2 %}) for "semi-pro" mode. You can find the essential anvi'o files [here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1621535) if you would like to reproduce any of the command lines in this text. For instance you can start with this one, which will start the interactive anvi'o environment:

``` bash
$ anvi-interactive -p PROFILE.db -c CONTIGS.db --state state
```


## A quick look at the assembled *Nitrospira* genome

Briefly, we downloaded the raw metagenomic data for three samples for ENR4 enrichment, and one sample for ENR6 enrichment, and using Bowtie2 with default parameters, we mapped the short reads back to the *Candidatus* Nitrospira inopinata genome (which will be shamelessly called "Wagner's Nitrospira" in my figures, for which I apologize .. when I first started this I didn't think I'd be writing about it).

In general the first thing we do after profiling and merging multiple metagenomic samples using anvi'o is to look at the "detection" view to see whether there are any segments that are not covered in any of the environments. Nothing surprising here as the entirety of the genome is covered in all four samples completely:

{:.notice}
Each bar in the following figures represents a 2,000 nt long split from the genome.

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/portion_covered.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/portion_covered.png" /></a>
</div>

Blue selections indicate the three loci that are key for nitrification. If you go clockwise, they correspond to **hao**, **nxr**, and **amo**, respectively (see the loci figure above).

The second thing we generally do is to take a look at the mean coverage of each split:

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/mean_coverage.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/mean_coverage.png" /></a>
</div>

Among multiple sections with inconsistent coverage across the genome, one is pretty striking. But before going into the details of that section, I want to see a better view of inconsistent coverage to identify parts that really stick out. The standard deviation around coverage view is perfect for this:

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/standard_deviation.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/standard_deviation.png" /></a>
</div>

Inspecting the split with the highest standard deviation (the one around 10:30 o'clock in the figure above) shows some evidence for potentially faulty assembly since this is not something you expect to see from a circular / complete genome:

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/highest_std_split.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/highest_std_split.png" /></a>
</div>

One explanation for this drop could be two contigs that are put together when they shouldn't have been put together. On the other hand the gene caller identifies a gene that goes right across this region [with some functional annotation, too]({{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/gene_call_in_highest_std_split.png). Puzzling.

<blockquote>
- <span style="color: #808080;">[Computer scientist]</span> Well, in a universe of endless possibilities, I really can't see why not the connecting ends of a chimeric contig happen to resolve to a proper gene.<br />

- <span style="color: #808080;">[Computer guy]</span> :(((

<div class="blockquote-author">Passive-aggressive monologues with self</div>
</blockquote>

And the gene is not a chimeric one: A BLAST search of this gene as it appears in the genome returns many hits on NCBI.

The top one is [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/952976782?report=genbank&log$=protalign&blast_rank=1&RID=6CA4CVDA015) with 100% identity, which is not surprising, but very cute regardless, as it shows that stuff people built, does work.

The other two in the top three are [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/953251357?report=genbank&log$=protalign&blast_rank=2&RID=6CA4CVDA015) and [this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/953251357?report=genbank&log$=protalign&blast_rank=2&RID=6CA4CVDA015) with 60%+ identity and 90%+ query coverage for both! Both of these hits are coming from enrichments done by the other group --who did not publish their raw data, and therefore shall not be mentioned here any further.

So yes, this gene is not chimeric, but according to the mapping, there is something weird going on with it. This is not a unique example, and the presence of these sudden drops in coverage may be suggesting that the genome needs more work to be considered "final final". Although, it may also be the case that this genome is already the best genome that could be generated from this dataset.

I also did an alternative assembly: I took all short reads from the three ENR4 samples, and one ENR6 sample, trimmed them to 150nts to avoid poor quality ends of both reads in each pair, and co-assembled them using [MEGAHIT](https://github.com/voutcn/megahit). Then I BLAST'ed each split in Wagner's Nitrospira genome against the resulting contigs from the assembly. Then I wrote a Python script to make sense of the BLAST result. A total of 2,187,422 nts from the assembly matched to the Nitrospira final genome. In other words, my assembly of their data recovered about 66% of the *Ca.* N. inopinata genome. And the average nucleotide identity between the matching 66% was 98.9%. It is normal that my assembly recovered only two-thirds of the genome since I didn't use longer reads as Wagner's group did, but the difference in nucleotide identity was surprising to me. On the other hand, although I am not sure which assembly is less right, 1% divergence may not be too concerning. I simply don't know.

OK, enough of this. Let's finally take a look from the [variability view]({% post_url anvio/2015-07-20-analyzing-variability %}), which shows the summary of the density of variation at each nucleotide position for each split based on mapped short reads:

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/variability.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/variability.png" /></a>
</div>

This is getting interesting! There are multiple regions in the genome that shows remarkable variation when short reads are mapped back. According to our experience, these regions often indicate heterogeneity in the source community, and we really like them as they have the potential to provide deeper insights into the ecology we are going after (and sometimes they are there as by products of bad assembly, or bad mapping). The true power of metagenomics come from co-assemblies and understanding community heterogeneity through these often-quite-subtle variations.

One of the highly variable regions across the genome overlap with the region that showed remarkable decrease in the mean coverage we saw in the mean coverage view:

<div class="centerimg">

</div>

A quick inspection indicates the presence of CRISPR-associated proteins, so I decide to highlight all CRISPR-associated genes on this view. I go back to my terminal, and type this to search for all functions that contains the term "CRISPR":

``` bash

This search generates a matrix file that shows where are all these CRISPR-associeated genes. I restart the interactive interface with this additional information:

``` bash
$ anvi-interactive -p PROFILE.db -c CONTIGS.db -A CRISPR-SPLITS.txt
```

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/crisprs.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/crisprs.png" /></a>
</div>

Now we have an extra layer in all anvi'o views for splits with CRISPR hits. Not every occurrence of a CRISPR-associated protein indicates a locus, but it seems there are two clusters of CRISPR-associated proteins right around a very highly variable region. This is what inspection shows for a split right in the middle of the most variable region:

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/crispr-split.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/crispr-split.png" /></a>
</div>

This view is probably not very surprising to people who study CRISPRs. Seeing the tremendous amount of diversity within the spacer / repeat region that follow Cas operons even within a rather homogeneous population of Nitrospira coming from an enrichment is still striking to me. It is a mess, but fortunately not a random one either; usually competing nucleotide identities at variable positions match across four samples:

<div class="centerimg">

</div>

### Breaking news: CRISPRs break your contigs ...

I also took multiple short reads Bowtie2 mapped to this crazy variable region, and BLASTed them against the genome. The result was quite scary: each read was broken into multiple alignments, and aligned to slightly different parts of this repeat region. This is *exactly* why your de brujin graph resolving assembler using short reads will never be able to recover itself from seeing a CRISPR region, and will end up braking up your contigs during the reconstruction. Wagner's group overcame this limitation of the assembly by using MinION reads.

While looking at this data I also realized that every CRISPR-associated protein I find in a contig collection from any metagenomic assembly *should be* at the very end of contigs in which they are identified. Of course repeats in CRISPR spacer region is only one of the issues that fragment our otherwise beautiful contigs, but it is something that is easier to test since the spacer region follows the well-described Cas operons we can look for. I took one of the assemblies Tom created from an ocean sample, and searched for CRISPR-associated proteins, and look what I've found:

|Contig|Contig length|Gene name|Gene start|Gene end|
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|contig_x|**5305**|CRISPR-associated protein, Csy3 family|3319|**4323**|
|contig_y|**3416**|CRISPR-associated protein, Cse1 family|2608|**3396**|
|contig_z|**306597**|CRISPR-associated protein Cas1|303304|**303714**|
|contig_t|**5600**|CRISPR-associated helicase Cas3|3952|**5334**|
|contig_n|**12451**|CRISPR-associated protein, Csd1 family|12064|**12393**|

They are truly towards the end of each contig. Scars of a nightmare the assembler run into.

### What if we tried a different mapping software?

The two screenshots from the CRISPR region is clearly concerning. That shows how many mismatches Bowtie2 allows by its default parameters. Just to see whether the story changes at all, I mapped all short reads from ENR4-A back to the genome using both Bowtie2 *and* BWA (aln and mem), and by using multiple values for number of mismatches allowed for aln (via *n*) and different seed lengths for mem (via *K*). The overall pattern of variability within these genomes did not change:

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/multiple-mappers.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/multiple-mappers.png" width="65%" /></a>
</div>

However, the mean coverage for highly-variable splits **did** change from one mapping to another. For instance, this is how these different mapping software compare to each other at the variable region in split 499 (see the figure above):

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/crispr-split-multiple-mappers.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/crispr-split-multiple-mappers.png" /></a>
</div>

Bowtie2 does a great job mapping anything and everything to the best context it can find. But when I made mapping a bit more stringent by playing BWA's parameters, a sharp decline in coverage in the spacer / repeat region has emerged. Here, it is much more clear at the very beginning of the spacer / split region, right after Cas operons:

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/crispr-beginning-of-repeat.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/crispr-beginning-of-repeat.png" /></a>
</div>

While the coverage with BWA MEM K200 drops almost 70%, it only drops about 20% with Bowtie2. The reads Bowtie2 manage to map indeed results in lots and lots of variable positions due to *non-specific* mapping.


### A likely reason for non-specific mapping

The reason for occasional non-specific mapping and/or dramatic shift in coverage is partly/likely because *Candidatus* Nitrospira inopinata is a *consensus genome*. When you look at those regions with decreased coverage, it is not the case that those reads that are *not* mapping to those regions, go somewhere else in the genome to counterbalance the drop. This can only be due to heterogeneity in the Nitrospira community. Because even if in fact the assembly is not perfect, there still are some reads that are mapping to it nicely, and some that are not mapping to it the same way. It is also important to note that there are *only* drops in this otherwise quite stably-covered genome. I think this particular scenario takes place in situations like enrichments: there is a very dominant population of very similar genomes, from which reads can only escape (when they don't agree with the consensus). In more complex datasets we often observe non-specific mapping that include bumps in coverages as well.

In the best-case scenario (and the one I'd put my money on) the assembly of *Candidatus* Nitrospira inopinata has no chimeric genes anywhere, and it accurately represents *at least one member* of the Nitrospira community. This probably is either very clear right off the bat, or makes a lot of sense to microbiologists, and to people who spent lots of time thinking about bacterial evolution. But as someone who recently transferred from the marker gene world, these are all surprising to me if I'm not making a terrible job at making sense of what I'm seeing, and my take home message from these observations is two folds:

* We are seeing heterogeneity at this level of resolution in naturally occurring populations thanks to metagenomics.
* Maybe we should be more skeptical of our convictions based on marker genes alone.

We looked at the microbial world using 3% OTUs and were surprised and confused about the diversity of bacteria. But I am starting to believe that there isn't even a meaningful *unit* to really discuss about the real diversity of the microbial world.

OK. Back to the topic. So, I'll just assume *Candidatus* Nitrospira inopinata is a consensus genome, and when almost all members of this community agrees with the most nucleotide information that's making up this genome, there are certain parts they disagree, hence the drop in coverage, or increase in variable positions. Remember that this is an enrichment study, and represents a very simple metagenome, yet here we are, dealing with changes in coverage or increase in variable positions in mapping results whether due to community heterogeneity or imperfections in assembly. How are we even supposed to rely on mapping results to study metagenomes when even the simplest metagenome challenges us with so much to understand? I have no answer to this myself. But I'm almost convinced that although it is essential, mapping short reads back to contigs is quite a pitiful way to make sense of metagenomes. To characterize metagenomes properly, we need to take a step back and work with graph structures directly instead of contigs reported by assemblers.


## The curious case of AmoC

Then I continued.

Decrease in the coverage around CRISPR operons is interesting, but I guess it is somewhat expected. On the other hand, a quick inspection of the 'amo' locus does show a clear decrease in the coverage of one of the genes in all four samples as well:

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/subunit-C.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/subunit-C.png" style="border: None;" /></a>
</div>

The annotation indicates that this gene is AmoC:

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/subunit-C-w-annotation.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/subunit-C-w-annotation.png" style="border: None;" /></a>
</div>

And mapping with BWA confirms the trend is not specific to Bowtie2:

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/AmoC-different-mappers.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/AmoC-different-mappers.png" style="border: None;" /></a>
</div>

The paper mentions that there are three copies of this gene in the genome.

The critical question is this: Where did the reads that did not map here go? Could they have mapped to the context of other AmoCs?

To identify which regions of the genome I should be looking for those other copies, I did a quick search using `anvi-search-functions-in-splits`:

``` bash
$ anvi-search-functions-in-splits -c CONTIGS.db \
                                  --search-terms "CH4_NH3mon_ox_C" \
                                  -o AmoC-hits.txt \
                                  --delimiter '!' \
                                  --full-report AmoC-report.txt

One of the output files, `AmoC-report.txt` shows the IDs of these three genes in the anvi'o contigs database for *Candidatus* Nitrospira inopinata, and split IDs that carry the gene:

|gene_callers_id|source|function|search_term|split_name|
|:--|:--:|:--|:--:|:--|
|709|TIGRFAM|CH4_NH3mon_ox_C: methane monooxygenase/ammonia monooxygenase, subunit C|CH4_NH3mon_ox_C|Nitrospira-Wagner_split_00368|
|1735|TIGRFAM|CH4_NH3mon_ox_C: methane monooxygenase/ammonia monooxygenase, subunit C|CH4_NH3mon_ox_C|Nitrospira-Wagner_split_00895|
|1184|TIGRFAM|CH4_NH3mon_ox_C: methane monooxygenase/ammonia monooxygenase, subunit C|CH4_NH3mon_ox_C|Nitrospira-Wagner_split_00606|

Inspecting splits 368, 606, and 895 showed that the drop in coverage for AmoC is common to all (sorry for the poor screenshot work for split 606, the gene was cut right in the middle, and the scales between the two splits differed):

</div>

To see which of the two are identical, I asked anvi'o to give me back the sequences for all these three AmoC genes from the genome:
 
``` bash
$ anvi-get-dna-sequences-for-gene-calls -c CONTIGS.db \
                                        -o AmoC-sequences.fa \
                                        --gene-caller-ids 709,1735,1184 \
                                        --wrap 0
Contigs DB ...................................: Initialized: CONTIGS.db (v. 4)
Output .......................................: AmoC-sequences.fa
```

The output file is a simple FASTA file:

So far so good, and this is what I know about all these:

* There are three AmoC, with anvi'o gene caller ids 709, 1184, and 1735, in anvi'o splits number 368, 606, and 895, respectively.
* The alignment shows that AmoC-1184-in-split-606 and AmoC-1735-in-split-895 are identical, and AmoC-709-in-split-368 is slightly different from both.
* The decrease in coverage is common to all AmoC genes, which is extremely interesting, and there are variable positions for all.


### An application of oligotyping in the metagenomic context: Oligotyping AmoC

One question worth going after is this: are the low frequency nucleotides at variable positions in AmoC coming from different reads, or is there a family of reads that that differ from the context they are being mapped to at each variable position?

Let's focus on these three nucleotide positions in AmoC-1735-in-split-895:

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/subunit-C-high-variability.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/subunit-C-high-variability.png" style="border: None;" /></a>
</div>

If you look at the alignment of three AmoC genes, you will realize that the variable positions in this figure correspond to the following positions where two unique AmoC differ in this genome:

(...)
</pre>

It is as if reads that must have been mapped to the context of AmoC-709-in-split-368, ended up being mapped to the context of AmoC-1735-in-split-895. But is it the case? We can easily get our answer by [oligotyping]({{ site.url }}/software/oligotyping) this region!

For an oligotyping analysis one can ask anvi'o to report back all short reads in a BAM file that cover each nucleotide position of interest (of course the maximum distance of these nucleotide positions should be smaller than the length of the short reads). For this I created a TAB-delimited file with the contig name I am interested in, and the nucleotide positions I recovered using the gene start position (see the figure above):

``` bash
$ cat AmoC-1735-variable-pos.txt
Nitrospira-Wagner	1788424,1788451,1788457
```

Then I called `anvi-report-linkmers`:

``` bash
$ anvi-report-linkmers --contigs-and-positions AmoC-1735-variable-pos.txt \
                       -i BAMs/*.bam \
                       -o AmoC-1735-linkmers.txt \
                       --only-complete-links

It seems the variation is not random, and it mostly is created by two read families. Here is a simple visualization of this matrix to make it even more obvious:

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/AmoC-oligotypes-with-three-locations.png"><img width="80%" src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/AmoC-oligotypes-with-three-locations.png" width="40%" /></a>
</div>

And by the way, yes, ENR3 samples and ENR6 do group separately based on the oligotypes (this is an MDS ordination generated by `metaMDS` in `vegan`):

<div class="centerimg">
<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/AmoC-oligotypes-ordination.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/2015-12-03-musings-over-commamox/AmoC-oligotypes-ordination.png" width="60%" /></a>
</div>

But this is where it gets very interesting:

It is clear that reads identified by oligotype CCG seem to be more fitting to AmoC-709-in-split-368. So why did they get mapped to AmoC-1735-in-split-895? I already showed that both BWA and Bowtie2 agrees with the decrease in coverage, and where the variable positions are. But nevertheless I will agree with you if you insist that the simplest explanation is still the mapping step that went wrong, and reads that should have been mapped to the context of AmoC-709-in-split-368 ended up getting mapped to the context of AmoC-1735-in-split-895.

To test this, I asked anvi'o to give me all the short reads from ENR4-A.bam that are mapped to AmoC-1735-in-split-895:

``` bash
$ anvi-get-short-reads-mapping-to-a-gene --gene-caller-id 1735 \
                                         -c CONTIGS.db \
                                         -i BAMs/ENR4-A.bam \
                                         -o ENR4-A-reads-mapping-to-1735.fa

Working on 'ENR4-A'

```

There I have the 1,384 reads that maps to this gene. Next, I created a FASTA file with only the two unique sequences of three AmoC:

``` bash
$ anvi-get-dna-sequences-for-gene-calls -c CONTIGS.db \
                                        -o AmoC-unique-sequences.fa \
                                        --gene-caller-ids 709,1735
```

Then used blastn to BLAST all 1,384 reads Bowtie2 aligned to the context of AmoC-1735-in-split-895 against the two competing AmoC sequences by asking a minimum of 99.25% sequence identity. I hope it is clear that if Bowtie2 made a mistake, almost half of these reads should best match to AmoC-709-in-split-368. 

``` bash
$ makeblastdb -in AmoC-unique-sequences.fa -dbtype nucl
$ blastn -query ENR4-A-reads-mapping-to-1735.fa \
         -db AmoC-unique-sequences.fa \
         -out output.b6 \
         -outfmt '6' \
         -perc_identity 99.25
$ wc -l output.b6
     378 output.b6
```

BLASTing gave back 378 unique hits (I made sure manually that they're all unique). The rest of the reads hit below 99.25% most probably due to sequencing errors, which is not surprising given the 300 nts length of these reads I used for this step.

When I took a look at the distribution of best hits, it was clear that Bowtie2 did a good job at finding the best position for almost all of them, as blastn agreed that the vast majority of reads ended up in the context of AmoC-1735-in-split-895 because there really was no other place for them to go:

``` bash
$ awk '{print $2}' output.b6 | awk 'BEGIN{FS="|"}{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c
 373 1735
   5 709
```

So it goes.


## Final words

Here where I keep my promise I made at the very beginning: There are no final words.

I am learning to accept to fact that we are going to be missing a great deal of things, and left great deal of questions unanswered even when we do our best with our data, and that's OK. Because at some point one has to stop analyzing, and write the study. But making sure the raw data is available is critical. Even the simplest metagenomes are too complex to fully describe, and I have so much respect for people who got us all this far.

I also thank [Michael Wagner](http://www.microbial-ecology.net/) and his colleagues for their contribution.
