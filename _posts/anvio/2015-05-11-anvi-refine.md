As you know, hierarchical clustering in anvi'o (that is necessary to represent a merged dataset as a nice looking tree) requires the maximum number of splits to be around 20,000.

If you have more, one way to do it is to profile your dataset with an `--min-contig-length` value that eliminates enough short contigs from your analysis so you can merge everything without any issues.

But what if you do not want to use a large `--min-contig-length` value and lose a lot of contigs that may increase your completion score?

Here is an example project with more 250,000 splits:

<div class="centerimg">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/annotationdb.png" />
</div>

One way to analyze this dataset is to rely on CONCOCT. For instance, you can profile each of your sample with `--min-contig-length` of 2500, and skip the hierarchical clustering during `anvi-merge`:

    $ anvi-merge */PROFILE.db -c contigs.db -o MERGED_PROFILE --skip-hierarchical-clustering

Although resulting merged profile would be missing all the trees that are used by `anvi-interactive`, it would contain clustering results from CONCOCT, therefore you would still have your genome bins identified. Which means, you can now run `anvi-summarize` on the merged data, and take a look at what's up:

    $ anvi-summarize -p MERGED_PROFILE/PROFILE.db -c contigs.contigsdb -C CONCOCT -o MERGED_SUMMARY

Big data is all about trade-offs. Relying on fully-automated genome binning means;

* You will be able to process very large number of contigs and get many many genome bins
* Many of your genome bins are not going to be as pure as you would like them

Although CONCOCT largely does great and gives a lot of near-complete genome bins with low contaamination, here is a couple of bins identified by CONCOCT in this dataset with a lot of contamination:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/bins.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/bins.png" width="100%" /></a>

## Solution: anvi-refine

Once you are here, you can use `anvi-refine` to switch to supervised binning and refine them by identifying separate genome bins by hand. Lets take `Group_6` as an example:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/group_6.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/group_6.png" width="100%" /></a>

Fortunately, there aren't 200,000 contigs in `Group_6`, which means we can analyze it using the default clustering and visualization workflow of anvi'o. To achieve that we can go back to our terminal and type this command:

<blockquote>I would suggest you to take a backup of your original profile database just in case if things go bad.</blockquote>

    $ anvi-refine -p MERGED_PROFILE/PROFILE.db -c contigs.db -C CONCOCT -b Group_6

With this command, anvi'o will take all contigs that were put in `Group_6` in the CONCOCT collection, along with the data associated with them stored in the contigs and profile databases, and run a hierarchical clustering on this subset, just to present you with the interactive interface so you can _refine_ this highly contaminated bin.

After a short wait while anvi'o gets everything sorted out, you are welcomed with the interactive interface:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/group_6_tree.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/group_6_tree.png" width="100%" /></a>

This tree shows every contig that was in `Group_6`, however, they are this time clustered by anvi'o.

You can immediately see why CONCOCT had hard time with them and ended up putting all them together: all these contigs are coming from genomes that are occurred *mostly* in sample `OS C`. As CONCOCT relies on differential distribution of genomes across samples, great similarity in the distribution of these genomes makes it very hard to confidently pull them apart. Which is not surprising. However, when we focus on this bin with anvi'o, we can see some tiny differences in distribution:

<div class="centerimg">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/group_6_detail.png" />
</div>

When anvi'o focuses only one CONCOCT group, these tiny differences become large enough to have three, very clear clusters as you can see from the tree:

<div class="centerimg">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/group_6_tree_detail.png" />
</div>

We know when we select all of them, the predicted contamination is about 170%. But if I click those branches to add them into separate groups:

<div class="centerimg">
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/group_6_tree_selections.png" />
</div>

The contamination drops down to much better levels:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/group_6_contamination.png" />

## Saving the refined group

When you click 'save', the interface will gracefully remove `Group_6` from the database, and add these new three groups instead. It is essential to give proper names to newly created groups if you would like to recognize them in the output. Once you are done, of course the next step is to re-run the summary:

    $ anvi-summarize -p MERGED_PROFILE/PROFILE.db -c contigs.db -C CONCOCT -o MERGED_SUMMARY

When you look at the output, you will see that this is not there anymore:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/group_6.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/group_6.png" width="100%" /></a>

And instead, you have this:

<a href="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/group_6_refined.png"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/anvio/refine/group_6_refined.png" width="100%" /></a>

Yay!
