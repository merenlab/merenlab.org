We are very happy to see early responses from the community to anvi'o since the the [anvi'o paper](https://peerj.com/articles/1319/) is published in PeerJ.

We decided that this might be a good time to start an e-mail list where people can ask questions if they run into issues during installation, or later while using the platform. Also an e-mail list can be very useful to send release notes, or other news regarding the platform.

Here is how you can subscribe to it.

## Joining the mail list

The e-mail list is served by Google Groups, and its web interface is here. But I suggest you send an empty e-mail to the following address and follow the instructions to complete your subscription (don't forget to check your SPAM folder for the auto-response):

    anvio+subscribe@googlegroups.com

You do not need to have a GMail account to subscribe to the list.

Messages from the group will have the word `[anvio]` in their subjects, based on which you can filter them in a directory in your e-mail client so they don't clutter your inbox. 

## Sending e-mails to the list

To send an e-mail, compose your message for this address:

    anvio@googlegroups.com
    
After joining to the list, don't hesitate to send an e-mail to the list to say hi! You know .. for testing whether it works or not.

## Leaving the list

All you need to do is to send an e-mail to this address, and follow the instructions in the response e-mail:

    anvio+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com
