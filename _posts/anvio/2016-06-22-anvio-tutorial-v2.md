{: .notice}
This tutorial is tailored for anvi'o <b>version 2.0.0, or later</b>. You can learn which version you have on your computer by typing `anvi-profile --version` in your terminal. The tutorial for older anvi'o releases from v1 family is [here]({% post_url anvio/2015-05-02-anvio-tutorial-v1 %}) (but **v1** is so 2015, and you should never use it ever again).

The goal of this tutorial is to provide a brief overview of the anvi'o workflow for the analysis of assembly-based shotgun metagenomic data. Throughout this tutorial you will primarily learn about the following topics:

* Process your contigs,

* Profile your metagenomic samples and merge them, 

* Visualize your data, identify and/or refine genome bins interactively, and create summaries of your results.

If we are missing things, or parts of the tutorial is not clear, please let us know, and we will do our best to improve it.

You should also feel free to contact us if you are not sure whether anvi'o is the platform to go after a certain question. 

---

If you are here, you must have already [installed]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-26-installation-v2 %}) the platform (hopefully without much trouble), and have run the infamous ["mini test"]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-26-installation-v2 %}#running-the-mini-test) successfully.

It is always a good idea to stick with stable versions of the platform, as the snapshots from [the codebase](http://github.com/meren/anvio) can be very unstable and/or broken. However we also need people who like to live at the edge, and who would follow the development, test new features, join discussions, and push us to do better.

You probably will run into issues while using anvi'o. We apologize for that in advance. But when that happens, please consider contacting us to give us a chance to address the problem for you. You can post a comment down below, join [the anvi'o discussion group]({% post_url anvio/2015-10-14-anvio-discussion-group %}), or open an <a href="https://github.com/meren/anvio/issues">issue</a>. Regardless of the method to connect, please don't forget to copy-paste the `anvi-interactive -v` output, the operating system you are using, or any other details that may be relevant to the problem.


## Preparation

To run the anvi'o metagenomic workflow, you will need these files:

* __A FASTA file of your contigs__. We shall call it `contigs.fa` throughout this manual. We will assume that `contigs.fa` contains contigs from a co-assembly. However, it may also have been a reference genome from NCBI, a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG), or a bunch of genes you are interested in profiling. Regardless of what it contains, following steps will not change too much.

* __BAM files__ for your samples. In fact you can use most of what anvi'o offers, including its binning capabilities, [even if you don't have any BAM files]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-06-working-with-contigs-only %}), but since you would be an outlier if its the case, let's continue with the more conventional scenario. Where you have your contigs, and one or more BAM files.

{:.notice}
To make things easier to follow, we will use three mock samples throughout this tutorial: `SAMPLE-01`, `SAMPLE-02`, and `SAMPLE-03` (in fact are subsampled from a human gut metagenome time series). By clicking the following links, you can download the `contigs.fa` and the three BAM files we generated by mapping short reads from each sample to `contigs.fa`: [contigs.fa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meren/anvio/master/tests/sandbox/contigs.fa), [SAMPLE-01-RAW.bam](https://github.com/meren/anvio/raw/master/tests/sandbox/SAMPLE-RAW-01.bam), [SAMPLE-02-RAW.bam](https://github.com/meren/anvio/raw/master/tests/sandbox/SAMPLE-RAW-02.bam), [SAMPLE-03-RAW.bam](https://github.com/meren/anvio/raw/master/tests/sandbox/SAMPLE-RAW-03.bam). Save them into a directory, and run every command in that directory throughout the tutorial.

For the contigs and BAM files for your *real data*, there is one more thing you have to make sure you have: *simple deflines*. Keep reading.

### Take a look at your FASTA file

**Your FASTA file must have simple deflines**, and if it doesn't have simple deflines, **you must fix your FASTA file prior to mapping**. This is necessary, because the names in `contigs.fa` **must** match the names in your BAM files. Unfortunately, different mapping software behave differently when they find a space character, or say a `|` character in your FASTA file, and they proceed to change those characters in arbitrary ways. Therefore it is essential to keep the sequence IDs in your FASTA file **as simple as possible** before mapping. To avoid any problems later, take a look at your deflines prior to mapping now, and remove anything that is not a digit, an ASCII letter, an underscore, or a dash character. Here are some bad deflines:

{% highlight bash %}
>Contig-123 length:4567 
>Another defline 42
>gi|478446819|gb|JN117275.2|
{% endhighlight %}

And here are some OK ones:

{% highlight bash %}
>Contig-123
>Another_defline_42
>gi_478446819_gb_JN117275_2
{% endhighlight %}

If you have bad deflines, you need to reformat your FASTA file, and do the mapping again (if you have done you mapping already, you can convert your BAM files into SAM files, edit the SAM file to correct deflines, and re-generate your BAM files with proper names, but these kind of error-prone hacks require a lot of attention to make sure you did not introduce a bug early on to your precious data).

### Re-formatting your input FASTA

You can use the following anvi'o script to fix your deflines:

{% highlight bash %}
$ anvi-script-reformat-fasta contigs.fa -o contigs-fixed.fa -l 0 --simplify-names
{% endhighlight %}

This script will give you your FASTA file with simplified deflines. If you use the flag `--report-file`, it will also create a TAB-delimited file for you to keep track of which defline in the new file corresponds to which defline in the original file. While you are here, it may also be a good idea to remove some very short contigs from your contigs file for a clean start. If you like that idea, you can run the same command this way to also remove sequences that are shorter than 1,000 nts:

{% highlight bash %}
$ anvi-script-reformat-fasta contigs.fa -o contigs-fixed.fa -l 1000 --simplify-names
{% endhighlight %}

Let's just overwrite the `contigs.fa` with `contigs-fixed.fa` here to make things simpler:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mv contigs-fixed.fa contigs.fa
{% endhighlight %}


## Creating an anvi'o contigs database

An anvi'o contigs database will keep all the information related to your contigs: positions of open reading frames, k-mer frequencies for each contigs, where splits start and end, functional and taxonomic annotation of genes, etc. The contigs database is an essential component of everything related to anvi'o metagenomic workflow.

### anvi-gen-contigs-database

The following is the simplest way of creating a contigs database:

{% highlight bash %}
$ anvi-gen-contigs-database -f contigs.fa -o contigs.db
{% endhighlight %}

When you run this command, `anvi-gen-contigs-database` will,

* **Compute k-mer frequencies** for each contig (the default is `4`, but you can change it using `--kmer-size` parameter if you feel adventurous).

* **Soft-split contigs** longer than 20,000 kbp into smaller ones (you can change the split size using the `--split-length`). When gene calling step is not skipped, the process splitting contigs will consider where genes are and avoid cutting genes in the middle. For very very large assemblies this process can take a while, and you can skip it with `--skip-mindful-splitting` flag.

* **Identify open reading frames** using [Prodigal](http://prodigal.ornl.gov/), the bacterial and archaeal gene finding program developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the University of Tennessee. If you don't want gene calling to be done, you can use the flag `--skip-gene-calling` to skip it. If you have your *own* gene calls, you can provide them to be used to identify where genes are in your contigs. All you need to do is to use the parameter `--external-gene-calls` (see down below for the format).

Almost every anvi'o program comes with a help menu that explains available parameters in detail. Don't forget to check them once in a while. If something is not clearly explained, please let us know so we can fix that:

{% highlight bash %}
$ anvi-gen-contigs-database --help
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have your contigs database, you can start importing things into it, or directly go to the profiling step.

<b><a name="external-gene-calls" style="color: black;">The</a> TAB-delimited file for `--external-gene-calls`</b> should follow this format:

{:.notice}
**Please note**: For a complete gene call where the value of `partial` is `0`, the number of nucleotides, i.e. the value of `stop - start`, must be divided by three **without** any remainder. Any other gene call is not a complete gene call, and must be identified as such by setting the value of `partial` to `1` so anvi'o does not try to translate their sequence. Otherwise anvi'o will be upset, and then frustrate you.

{:.notice}
**Please note**: anvi'o follows the convention of string indexing and splicing that is identical the way one does it in Python or C.

The statement above means that the index of the first nucleotide in any contig should be `0`. In other words, we start counting from `0`, not from `1`. The `start` and `stop` positions in the input file should comply with this. Here is an example gene in a contig:

{% highlight bash %}
                 1         2         3
nt pos: 12345678901234567890123456789012 (...)
contig: NNNATGNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTAGAAAAAA (...)
           |______ gene X _______|
{% endhighlight %}

The `start` and `stop` positions in the input file for this gene should be `3` and `26`, respectively. If you think we should change this behavior, please let us know (here is a [relevant issue](https://github.com/meren/anvio/issues/374)). Thanks for your patience!


### anvi-run-hmms

Although this is absolutely optional, you shouldn't skip this step. Anvi'o can do a lot with hidden Markov models ([HMMs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) provide statistical means to model complex data in probabilistic terms that can be used to search for patterns, which works beautifully in bioinformatics where we create models from known sequences, and then search for those patterns rapidly in a pool of unknown sequences to recover hits). To decorate your contigs database with hits from HMM models that ship with the platform (which, at this point, constitute multiple published bacterial single-copy gene collections), run this command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ anvi-run-hmms -c contigs.db
{% endhighlight %}

When you run this command (without any other parameters),

* It will utilize multiple default bacterial single-copy core gene collections and identify hits among your genes to those collections using HMMER. If you have already run this once, and now would like to add an HMM profile of your own, that is easy. You can use `--hmm-profile-dir` parameter to declare where should anvi'o look for it.

* Note that the program will use only one CPU by default, especially if you have multiple of them available to you, you should use the `--num-threads` parameter. It significantly improves the runtime, since [HMMER](http://hmmer.org/) is truly an awesome software.

### anvi-import-taxonomy

Annotating genes with taxonomy makes things downstream much more meaningful, and improves the human guided binning and refinement steps later on. Please see this post to find out different ways to achieve that:

- [**Importing taxonomy into anvi'o**]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-18-importing-taxonomy %}).

### anvi-import-functions

Anvi'o can make good use of functional annotations of genes. Please see the following post to see how to import functions into anvi'o:

- [**Importing functions into anvi'o**]({% post_url anvio/2016-06-18-importing-functions %}).


## Profiling BAM files

If you are here, you must be done with your contigs database, and have your BAM files ready. Good! It is time to initialize your BAM file, and create an *anvi'o profile* for your sample.

### anvi-init-bam

Anvi'o requires BAM files to be sorted and indexed. In most cases the BAM file you get back from your mapping software will not be sorted and indexed. This is why we named the BAM file for our mock samples as `SAMPLE-01-RAW.bam`, instead of `SAMPLE-01.bam`.

If your BAM files already sorted and indexed (i.e., for each `.bam` file you have there also is a `.bam.bai` file in the same directory), you can skip this step. Otherwise, you need to initialize your BAM files:

{% highlight bash %}
$ anvi-init-bam SAMPLE-01-RAW.bam -o SAMPLE-01.bam
{% endhighlight %}

But of course it is not fun to do every BAM file you have one by one. So what to do?

A slightly better way to do would require you to do it in a `for` loop. First create a file called, say, `SAMPLE_IDs`. For your samples (`X` and `Y`) it will look like this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cat SAMPLE_IDs
SAMPLE-01
SAMPLE-02
SAMPLE-03
{% endhighlight %}

Then, you can run `anvi-init-bam` on all of them by typing this:

{% highlight bash %}
for sample in `cat SAMPLE_IDs`; do anvi-init-bam $sample-raw.bam -o $sample.bam; done
{% endhighlight %}

Of course if you have a way to cluster your runs, you already know what to do.

One last note, `anvi-init-bam` uses [samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools) in the background to do sorting and indexing. While clearly a big thanks and all the credit go to samtools developers, this is also a reminder that you can get your BAM files sorted and indexed using the samtools command line client without using `anvi-init-bam`.

OK. Good.

### anvi-profile

In contrast to the contigs database, an anvi'o profile database stores sample-specific information about contigs. Profiling a BAM file with anvi'o using `anvi-profile` creates a single profile that reports properties for each contig in a single sample based on mapping results. Each profile database links to a contigs database, and anvi’o can merge single profiles that link to the same contigs database into merged profiles (which will be covered later).

In other words, the profiling step makes sense of each BAM file separately by utilizing the information stored in the contigs database. It is one of the most critical (and also most complex and computationally demanding) steps of the metagenomic workflow.

The simplest form of the command that starts the profiling looks like this:

{% highlight bash %}
$ anvi-profile -i SAMPLE-01.bam -c contigs.db
{% endhighlight %}

When you run `anvi-profile` it will,

* Process each contig that is longer than `2,500 nts` by default. You can change this value by using `--min-contig-length` flag. But you should remember that the minimum contig length should be long enough for tetra-nucleotide frequencies to have enough meaningful signal. There is no way to define a golden number for minimum length that would be applicable to genomes found in all environments. We empirically chose the default to be 2,500, and have been happy with it. You are welcome to experiment, but we advise you to never go below 1,000. You also should remember that the lower you go, the more time it will take to analyze all contigs. You can use --list-contigs parameter to have an idea how many contigs would be discarded for a given `--min-contig-length` parameter. If you have an arbitrary list of contigs you want to profile, you can use the flag `--contigs-of-interest` to ignore the rest.

* Make up some crappy output directory, and sample names for you. We encourage you to use `--output-dir` parameter to tell anvi'o where to store your output files, and `--sample-name` parameter to give a meaningful, preferably not-so-long sample name to be stored in the profile database. This name will appear almost everywhere, and changing it later will be a pain.

Processing of contigs will include,

* The recovery of mean coverage, standard deviation of coverage, and the average coverage for the inner quartiles (Q1 and Q3) for a given contig. Profiling will also create an HD5 file where the coverage value for *each nucleotide position* will be kept for each contig for later use. While the profiling recovers all the coverage information, it can discard some contigs with very low coverage declared by `--min-mean-coverage` parameter (the default is 0, so everything is kept).

* The characterization of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) for every nucleotide position, unless you use `--skip-SNV-profiling` flag to skip it altogether (you will definitely gain a lot of time if you do that, but then, you know, maybe you shouldn't). By default, the profiler will not pay attention to any nucleotide position with less than `10X` coverage. You can change this behavior via `--min-coverage-for-variability` flag. Anvi'o uses a conservative heuristic to not report every position with variation: i.e., if you have 200X coverage in a position, and only one of the bases disagree with the reference or consensus nucleotide, it is very likely that this is due to a mapping or sequencing error, and anvi'o tries to avoid those positions. If you want anvi'o to report everything, you can use `--report-variability-full` flag. We encourage you to experiment with it, maybe with a small set of contigs, but in general you should refrain reporting everything (it will make your databases grow larger and larger, and everything will take longer for -99% of the time- no good reason). 

* Finally, because single profiles are rarely used for genome binning or visualization, and since clustering step increases the profiling runtime for no good reason, the default behavior of profiling is to *not cluster*. However, if you are planning to visualize single profiles (without merging), you can use `--cluster-contigs` flag (more explanation on this will come later) to. You don't need to use this flag if you are planning to merge multiple profiles (i.e., if you have more than one BAM files to work with, which will be the case for most people).

{:.notice}
Every anvi'o profile that will be merged later, must be generated with the same exact parameters and against the same contigs database. Otherwise anvi'o will complain about it later and don't merge anything. Just saying.


## Working with anvi'o profiles

You have all your BAM files profiled! Did it take forever? Well, sorry about that. But now you are golden.

### anvi-merge

The next step in the workflow is to to merge all anvi'o profiles.

This is the simplest form of the `anvi-merge` command:

{% highlight bash %}
$ anvi-merge SAMPLE-01/RUNINFO.cp SAMPLE-02/RUNINFO.cp SAMPLE-03/RUNINFO.cp -o SAMPLES-MERGED -c contigs.db
{% endhighlight %}

Or alternatively you can run it like this (if your work directory contains multiple samples to be merged):

{% highlight bash %}
$ anvi-merge */RUNINFO.cp -o SAMPLES-MERGED -c contigs.db
{% endhighlight %}

{:.notice}
Please don't forget to give a short, simple, and descriptive sample name using `--sample-name` parameter, because it will appear in a lot of places later.

When you run `anvi-merge`,

* It will merge everything and create a merged profile (yes, thanks, captain obvious),

* It will attempt to create multiple clusterings of your splits using the default _clustering configurations_ (if you like, you can take a quick look at these [configurations for merged profiles](https://github.com/meren/anvio/tree/master/anvio/data/clusterconfigs/merged) --they are pretty easy to understand). Hierarchical clustering results are necessary for comprehensive visualization, and human guided binning, therefore, by default, anvi'o attempts to cluster your contigs using default configurations. You can skip this step by using `--skip-hierarchical-clustering` flag. But even if you don't skip it, anvi'o will skip it for you if you have more than 20,000 splits, since the computational complexity of this process will get less and less feasible with increasing number of splits. That's OK, though. There are many ways to recover from this. On the other hand, if you want to teach everyone who is the boss, you can force anvi'o try to cluster your splits regardless of how many of them are there by using `--enforce-hierarchical-clustering` flag. You have the power.

* It will attempt to run [CONCOCT](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v11/n11/full/nmeth.3103.html) to bin your splits automatically. CONCOCT can deal with hundreds of thousands of splits. Which means, regardless of the number of splits you have, and even if you skip the hierarchical clustering step, there will be a collection in the merged profile database (which will be called `CONCOCT`) with genome bins identified by CONCOCT in an automatic manner. From which you can generate a summary, or run the interactive interface with `--collection-name CONCOCT` parameter (more later on these). But if you would like to skip default CONCOCT clustering, you can use `--skip-concoct-binning` flag. 


### anvi-import-collections

If you have your own binning of your contigs, you can easily import those results into the merged profile database as a collection:

{% highlight bash %}
$ anvi-import-collection binning_results.txt -p SAMPLES-MERGED/PROFILE.db -c contigs.db --source "SOURCE_NAME"
{% endhighlight %}

Two points:

* It is common that we use `anvi-export-splits-and-coverages` to export coverage and sequence composition information to bin our contigs with software that can work with coverage and sequence composition information. In this case, our `binning_results.txt` contains *split names*. But if you have contig names, you can import them using `anvi-import-collection` with the flag `--contigs-mode`. 

* You can also use an information file with the `--bins-info` parameter to describe the source of your bins (and even assign them some colors to have some specific visual identifiers for any type of visualization downstream).

There are example files [here](https://github.com/meren/anvio/tree/master/tests/sandbox/example_files_for_external_binning_results) that show the difference between input files for splits and contigs, and demonstrate the structure of the optional bins information file.

{:.notice}
You can use `anvi-export-collection` to export collection information and import into other profiles. It becomes very handy when you are doing [benchmarking between different approaches](% post_url anvio/2015-06-23-comparing-different-mapping-software %).


### anvi-interactive

Anvi'o interactive interface is one of the most sophisticated parts of anvi'o. In the context of the metagenomic workflow, the interactive interface allows you to browse your data in an intuitive way as it shows multiple aspects of your data, visualize the results of unsupervised binning, perform supervised binning, or refine existing bins.

{:.notice}
The interactive interface of anvi'o is written from scratch, and can do much more than what is mentioned above. In fact, you don't even need anvi'o profiles to visualize your data using the interactive interface. But since this is a tutorial for the metagenomic workflow, we will save you from these details. If you are intersted to learn more, we have other resources that provide **detailed descriptions of [the anvi'o interactive interface and data formats it works with]({% post_url anvio/2016-02-27-the-anvio-interactive-interface %})**.

{:.notice}
Most things you did so far (creating a contigs database, profiling your BAM files, merging them, etc) required you to work on a server. But `anvi-interactive` will require you to download the merged directory, and your contigs databases to your own computer, because `anvi-interactive` uses a browser to interact with you. If you don't want to download anything, you can use dig an SSH tunnel to use your server to run `anvi-interactive`, and the browser on your computer to interact with it. See the post on **[visualizing from a server]({% post_url anvio/2015-11-28-visualizing-from-a-server %})**.

This is the simplest way to run the interactive interface on your merged anvi'o profile: 

{% highlight bash %}
$ anvi-interactive -p SAMPLES-MERGED/PROFILE.db -c contigs.db
{% endhighlight %}

This will work perfectly if your merged profile has its trees (i.e., the hierarchical clustering mentioned in the `anvi-merge` section was *done*). Alternatively, you can use this notation to visualize a collection; this time each leaf of the tree will be a bin, along with completion and redundancy estimates, and distribution of it across samples:

{% highlight bash %}
$ anvi-interactive -p SAMPLES-MERGED/PROFILE.db -c contigs.db -C CONCOCT
{% endhighlight %}

When you run `anvi-interactive` with a collection name, it will on the fly compute various characteristics of each bin, i.e., their mean coverage, variability, completion and redundancy estimates, and generate anvi'o views for them to display their distribution across your samples in the interactive interface. Briefly, each *leaf* of the anvi'o central dendrogram will represent a "bin" in your collection, instead of a "contig" in your metagenomic assembly. Here is the big advantage: if you have run `anvi-merge` with `--skip-hierarchical-clustering` parameter due to the large number of contigs you had, but if you have binning results available to you from an external resource, you can import those bins as described in the previous section, and run the interactive interface with the collection id.


### anvi-gen-samples-info-database

This is an optional database purely to improve visualization. Please see this article for more information:

- [**Anvi'o samples database**]({% post_url anvio/2015-11-10-samples-db %}).


### anvi-summarize

A *collection* represents one or more bins with one or more contigs. Collections are stored in anvi'o databases can be imported from the results of external binning software, or saved through the anvi-interactive interface after a human-guided binning effort. Once you have a collection, you can *summarize* it using `anvi-summarize`.

The result of `anvi-summary` is a static HTML output you can browse in your browser, send to your colleagues, put it on your web page (an example from one of our papers is [here](http://anvio.org/data/INFANT-CLC-SUMMARY-SUPERVISED/)), or attach it to your submission as a supplementary data for review. When you run `anvi-summarize`,

* All your splits will be merged back to contigs and stored as FASTA files,

* Completion and redundancy estimates for each bin in a collection will be computed and stored in the output,

* TAB-delimited matrix files will be generated for genome bins across your samples with respect to their mean coverage, variability, etc.

You can run this to summarize the bins saved under the collection id 'CONCOCT' into MY_SUMMARY directory:

{% highlight bash %}
anvi-summarize -p SAMPLES-MERGED/PROFILE.db -c contigs.db -o SAMPLES-SUMMARY -C CONCOCT
{% endhighlight %}

If you are not sure which collections are available to you, you can always see a list of them by running this command:

{% highlight bash %}
anvi-summarize -p SAMPLES-MERGED/PROFILE.db -c contigs.db --list-collections
{% endhighlight %}

The summary process can take a lot of time. If you want to take a quick look to identify which bins need to be refined, you can run `anvi-summarize` with `--quick-summary` flag.

### anvi-refine

After running `anvi-summarize`, you may realize that you are not happy with one or more of your bins. This often is the case when you are working with very large datasets and when you are forced to skip the human guided binning step. `anvi-summarize` gives you the ability to make finer adjustments to a bin that may be contaminated.

After you refine bins that needs attention, you can re-generate your static summary.

## FAQ

### I run into an issue, whose fault is it?

It is Tom's. But you can always enter a [bug report](https://github.com/meren/anvio/issues) if you are certain that it needs to be fixed in the anvi'o code base. If you are not sure, please come to [the anvi'o discussion group]({% post_url anvio/2015-10-14-anvio-discussion-group %}), and let's talk about it!
