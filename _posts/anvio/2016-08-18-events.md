Here you can find a list of past and future anvi'o workshops and events.

{:.notice}
We are happy to organize (or participate to) metagenomics workshops given there is interest and we are able. The purpose of this paragraph is to communicate our needs from those who are interested in inviting us to offer a workshop. We are more than happy to consider invitations if our hosts are willing meet the following general requests. These expectations are not written on stone and are open to discussion, however, they help set the stage properly to make sure our mindset is clearly communicated. We generally request institutions to (1) be prepared to host us (usually Meren and Ozcan) for two full days, (2) make the workshop publicly accessible (i.e., keeping 30-40% of the seats to those who may want to attend from outside institutions), (3) offer free lunch to all attendees (since outsiders often struggle to find appropriate places to eat within the time constraints of the dense workshop schedule), and (4) provide coffee and healthy snacks for our breaks. We do not request (or accept even when we are offered) any monetary compensations for our time at workshops we offer, but we except our basic travel expenses to be covered (i.e., economy class flights and basic accommodation at somewhere near the event location). Finally, we request our hosts to consider not charging the participants any attendance fee to maximize the accessibility of these events to underrepresented groups. Thank you very much :)

After years of teaching in many places, I can confidently say that [#EBAME](https://twitter.com/hashtag/EBAME?src=hash) is one of the best 'omics workshops I've ever attended. Seriously. The workshop organization, which is led by [Lois Maignien](https://twitter.com/LoiMai), has consistently delivered its top game with infrastructure and socials, and Brest gave us more scenery than we could handle.

**Aftermath**: Although how well we did to go through the workshop topics is open to discussion, we probably were most successful at making the most out of the cozy space that was available to us:

Which inspired this haiku from [Jessica Mark Welch](http://www.mbl.edu/jbpc/staff/jmarkwelch/):

Science, laughter, anvi'o <br />
In a room for twelve

## Aug 2016, MontrÃ©al (Canada)

"*The First Traditional Anvi'o Colloquium in MontrÃ©al*" (hehe) has been quite fun. Myself, Tom Delmont and the 20-some participants of our tiny workshop were pleasantly surprised by the effort [Nicolas Tromas](https://twitter.com/NTromas) put into arranging this event. I thank him and [Jesse Shapiro](http://www.shapirolab.ca/) very much for making this a possibility.

We talked a lot about challenges and opportunities emerge from metagenomics, and about using anvi'o as a workbench to explore complex metagenomic data. I thank all participants for their patience, great questions, and feedback!

During the workshop I lost a historical battle, and finally agreed to make the necessary changes for `anvi-gen-variability-profile` to *also* [report]({% post_url anvio/2015-07-20-analyzing-variability %}/#the-output-matrix) `dN/dS` for each variable nucleotide position by default. I made very good arguments, but they didn't work.

I also thank Adrien for this sketch, although it makes me look much cooler than I do:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/merenbey">@merenbey</a> focused on the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/anvio?src=hash">#anvio</a> workshop.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Our workshop was right after **ISME 2016** conference, during which we had many missed interactions with friends and colleagues, which made it totally worth carrying an anvi'o poster all they way to Montreal:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The anvi&#39;o poster is up at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ISME16?src=hash">#ISME16</a>: <a href="https://t.co/cMEQYex2Na">pic.twitter.com/cMEQYex2Na</a></p>&mdash; A.

## Aug 2016, Woods Hole (USA)

STAMPS was very exciting this year. This was the first time Tom and I presented anvi'o to a large crowd, and heard back some very encouraging feedbacks:

## July 2016, Hawai'i (USA)

ECOGEO covered multiple topics. The first day there was a UNIX tutorial by Ken, and lots of marker gene stuff from multiple people. The second day there were four modules: assembly, binning, annotation, and phylogenetics. I -for the first time- used anvi'o to compare binning tools.

Here is Ken teaching UNIX to the class the first day:
