[QIIME](http://qiime.org/) is one of the most widely-used pipelines among microbial ecologists to analyze their high-throughput sequencing data. The more people wants to try oligotyping, the more common it is asked how can one jump from QIIME into the oligotyping pipeline quickly. [James Meadow](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_OIfYf4AAAAJ), a scientist from [The Institute of Ecology and Evolution](http://ie2.uoregon.edu/), University of Oregon, kindly shared his experience with QIIME and oligotyping pipelines for researchers who wish to take some of their data from QIIME into the oligotyping pipeline to analyze them further.
