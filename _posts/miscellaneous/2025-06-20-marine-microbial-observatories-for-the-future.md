## About the Workshop
_Marine Microbial Observatories for the Future: From Samples to Data to Legacy Using Integrated Omics Strategies_ is a two-day workshop, aimed at laying the groundwork for a lasting legacy of microbial observations in the ocean.

As part of ongoing international efforts to advance 'omics-based observing of marine biodiversity, this workshop responds to a growing need to ensure that microbial observations, samples, and data are not only scientifically robust but also sustainable, reusable, and policy-relevant over time.

The workshop brings together a multidisciplinary group of experts in:

* Environmental metagenomics
* Time-series & ship-based ocean observations
* Global coordination networks
* Data users
* Data and sample management
* Policy and governance
* Publishing

Together, we will:

* Identify key challenges in observing marine microbes using 'omics approaches
* Facilitate the exchange of lessons learned across observing efforts
* Develop strategies and solutions for long-term coordination and impact

An expected outcome of the workshop is a synthesis paper that distills these discussions and outlines a collective vision for the future of microbial ocean observing.
