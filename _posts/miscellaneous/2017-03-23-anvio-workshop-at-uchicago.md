{:.notice}
If you are certainly planning to come, **please let us know by sending an e-mail to meren [at] uchicago.edu**. In your e-mail please mention (1) the lab you are affiliated with (including the department and the university), (2) the environment you are studying, (3) the type of data you have, and (4) what do you expect to learn/discuss while you are at the workshop. Please feel free to ask questions at the comments section).


During the last year we traveled to [many places]({% post_url anvio/2016-08-18-events %}) to talk about [anvi'o](http://merenlab.org/software/anvio), and now we are inviting you to come to us.

This was possible thanks to the [Department of Medicine](http://medicine.uchicago.edu/), [Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition](http://medicine.uchicago.edu/gast/index.html), as well as [the Digestive Diseases Research Core Center (DDRCC)](http://www.uchicagoddrcc.org/) at the [University of Chicago](http://www.uchicago.edu). We are thankful for their support.

We will run a two-days anvi'o workshop at the University of Chicago on the **26<sup>th</sup> and 27<sup>th</sup> of April, 2017**. **As of today this is almost only a month away, so if you are planning to attend, you should act quickly**.

Here are some quick information for people who are still reading this page:

* **The workshop is free, but the space is limited** (if you are reading this, it means there is space, and if you are interested in coming, please send an e-mail). **We are planning to host about 30 people**.

* We will offer you lunch, snacks, water, tea, coffee, internet, and electricity (we also have chairs, desks, and restrooms), but you will need to take care of your travel (if you are coming from outside of Chicago).

* **Yes**, we indeed strategically planned this event to take place right after the [2017 Microbiome Center Research Symposium](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2017-microbiome-center-research-symposium-registration-31297813603), so you can plan accordingly if you want and feel much better about your spectacular pragmatism.

* If you end up coming, in a cozy room with a great view, we will tell you about how to **visualize complex data** using anvi'o, as well as **working with genomes, metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, and pangenomes** in anvi'o. You will also hear about other things including **single-nucleotide variant detection and profiling, or refining of metagenome-assembled genomes**. Depending on the interest, there may be spontaneous discussions about any set of issues regarding 'omics data analysis and visualization.

* We are hoping this will be an opportunity to learn from each other in a friendly environment. Although we will keep things as simple and as clear as possible, **we encourage you to consider attending this workshop if you are a software developer or a power user** (because we won't hold back and will be ready to dive into the code whenever it is relevant).

* You are a perfect candidate to attend to this **if you have genomic / metagenomic / metatranscriptomic data, and you explore best ways to analyze them**. This workshop wouldn't be the best use of your time if your current endeavors exclusively revolve around marker gene amplicon data.

* Although we are located in the Department of Medicine, we have interest in exploring the microbial life not only in mammalian guts or only in the context of health and disease, but also in oceans, soils, and other ecosystems. Do not feel that your environments or questions may be irrelevant. Ecology is happening everywhere, we are not afraid of anything, and you should just _bring it on_.

This will likely be a lot of fun. Or it will be "*just OK*". Talk to your supervisor, and show them a couple of anvi'o figures. Are you the supervisor? Well, then you know the right thing to do.

We will keep this page up-to-date as things progress, but please use the comments section to ask questions.

Thank you, and see you soon!
