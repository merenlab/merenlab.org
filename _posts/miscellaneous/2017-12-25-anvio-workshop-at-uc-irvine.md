We are are happy to announce a 2-day workshop at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/)! We will keep this page up-to-date with more information as things get clearer. But here are some quick facts.

<div class="extra-info" markdown="1">

<span class="extra-info-header">Thanks!</span>

This workshop is hosted by **[UCI Microbiome Initiative](http://microbiome.uci.edu/)**. We thank them for their interest and support!
</div>


* The workshop will take place at the University of California, Irvine, and more specifically in Calit2 Seminar Room 3008 on the **19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> of March, 2018**.

* **The workshop is free and open to public, but the space is limited**. We have space for **30 attendees**. You will have access to snacks, water, coffee/tea, internet, electricity, chairs, desks, and restrooms (yay!). But you will need to take care of your travel and accommodation if you are going to be coming to the workshop from elsewhere.

* **If you are interested in attending, please fill out the application form above at your earliest convenience**. The application deadline is **February 1, 2018**, and we will contact every applicant before **February 7, 2018** so they can finalize their travel arrangements. If we have more than 30 applications we will have to make selections. The criteria we will observe for this frustrating task of selecting 30 attendees will include attention to gender balance, increased diversity of home institutions (so attendees have some networking opportunities), and attendee backgrounds (so there are different perspectives).

* We are hoping that this will be an opportunity to learn from each other in a friendly environment. Although we will keep things as simple and as clear as possible, **we encourage software developers or power users who deal with metgenomes to consider attending**.

* You are a perfect candidate for this workshop **if you have genomic / metagenomic / metatranscriptomic data, and you explore best ways to analyze them**. This workshop wouldn't be the best use of your time if your current research endeavors largely revolve around amplicon sequences from marker genes (such as the 16S rRNA gene).

* We will have example datasets for you to follow everything on your anvi'o installed computers.

* This will likely be fun. Or it will be "*just OK*". Regardless, [here are some testimonials]({% post_url anvio/2017-07-12-testimonials %}){:target="_blank"} from anvi'o users to see the breadth of research endeavours anvi'o can facilitate. If this sounds inteersting, talk to your supervisor. If you are the supervisor, send your students.

We will keep this page up-to-date as things progress, but please use the comments section if you have any questions.

Thank you very much for your interest, and we look forward to seeing you soon!
