Welcome, and thank you for your interest!

The link to the registration form is at the end of this post. But we will assume that you have read everything on this page! :)

## Motivation

**The primary aim of this seminar series is to give a broad introduction to some of the key concepts and strategies that enable us to study the ecology, evolution, and functioning of naturally occurring microbial populations.**

The last several years witnessed tremendous advances in molecular and computational approaches which now offer unprecedented access to naturally occurring microbial communities through new *'omics* strategies. Developing an overall understanding of these strategies -including the ability to identify their appropriate applications and shortcomings- has quietly become a *de facto* necessity in the journey of an independent life scientist.

While most of these strategies are quite accessible thanks to the increasing number of computational tools and pipelines, without a complete understanding of the key concepts, exploiting available computational solutions to address unique scientific questions remain difficult. The purpose of the seminar series is to offer some introductions to key concepts, without talking about practical applications of tools.

## Target audience

**The target audience of this seminar series is beginners from all backgrounds who are interested in microbial 'omics**. Even if you have never been exposed to the strategies the seminars will cover, you will likely to be able to follow the content and discussions.

Seminars will use simple terms and simple language as much as possible.

## Seminar format

Each week there will be a seminar on Zoom, and each seminar will be composed of two sections: lecture, and discussion.

### Lecture part

**Lectures** will take approximately an hour and will use slides for presentation.

### Discussion part

**Discussions** will take and additional 30 to 45 minutes and will be dedicated to **questions, exchange of ideas, and practical considerations**. Although the target audience is beginners, our sessions will undoubtedly include researchers who are experienced on the topic and will be encouraged to take part in discussions.

## Lecturers

* [Meren](https://twitter.com/merenbey): Assistant Professor at the [University of Chicago](http://uchicago.edu), and a Fellow of the [Marine Biological Laboratory](http://mbl.edu).

* [Mike Lee](https://twitter.com/AstrobioMike): Research Scientist at NASA’s [Ames Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/ames). *Dr. Lee will lead the Phylogenomics session.*

## Schedule

**Every lecture will take place on a Wednesday at 9am Chicago Time (CST)** ([see what time it corresponds to in your city](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20200708T140000&p1=64&p2=259&p3=240&p4=514&p5=770&p6=676&p7=233&p8=246&p9=155&p10=250&p11=16&p12=176)).

## Logistics

We will use Zoom for lectures. If you plan to attend, please [download](https://zoom.us/download) the latest version of Zoom beforehand. If you already have Zoom installed on your computer, please make sure it is up to date.

Any participant will be able to unmute themselves to ask questions verbally, or use the chat window to do it in written form during the lecture or discussion sections. A person who will be identified at the beginning of each seminar will interrupt the speaker at appropriate times and brings up questions from the chat window.

If you are registered for a given week, you will get an e-mail 15 minutes before the lecture start time with the Zoom link that will enable you to connect.

## Registration

Seminars are free to attend and open to anyone! However, we request you to register using the following form:
