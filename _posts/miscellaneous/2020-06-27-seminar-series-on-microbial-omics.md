Welcome, and thank you for your interest! The microbial 'omics seminar series of 2020 is now over, but in this page you can find the recorded lectures.

## Motivation

**The primary aim of this seminar series was to give a broad introduction to some of the key concepts and strategies that enable us to study the ecology, evolution, and functioning of naturally occurring microbial populations.**

The last several years witnessed tremendous advances in molecular and computational approaches which now offer unprecedented access to naturally occurring microbial communities through new *'omics* strategies. Developing an overall understanding of these strategies -including the ability to identify their appropriate applications and shortcomings- has quietly become a *de facto* necessity in the journey of an independent life scientist.

While most of these strategies are quite accessible thanks to the increasing number of computational tools and pipelines, without a complete understanding of the key concepts, exploiting available computational solutions to address unique scientific questions remain difficult. The purpose of the seminar series is to offer some introductions to key concepts, without talking about tools or their practical applications.

## Target audience

**The target audience of this seminar series is beginners from all backgrounds who are interested in microbial 'omics**.

Even if you have never been exposed to the strategies the seminars will cover, you will likely to be able to follow the content and discussions.

Seminars will use simple terms and simple language as much as possible.

## Lecturers

* **[Meren](https://twitter.com/merenbey)**: Assistant Professor in the [Department of Medicine](https://medicine.uchicago.edu/) and the [Committee on Microbiology](https://biomedsciences.uchicago.edu/page/microbiology) at the **[University of Chicago](http://uchicago.edu)**, and a Fellow of the **[Marine Biological Laboratory](http://mbl.edu)**.

* **[Roland Hatzenpichler](http://www.environmental-microbiology.com)**, Assistant Professor in the Department of [Chemistry and Biochemistry](https://chemistry.montana.edu/), the [Thermal Biology Institute](http://tbi.montana.edu/), and the [Center for Biofilm Engineering](http://www.biofilm.montana.edu/) at **[Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu/)**. *Roland led a discussion on what we do <u>not</u> learn about microbial associations from sequencing alone.*

## Future

We are hoping to put together another seminar series later on bioinformatics approaches that give access to 'omics strategies covered in this introductory seminar series. Meanwhile, please use the comments section down below or find us on Disord if you have any comments or suggestions.
