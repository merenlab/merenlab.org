<span class="extra-info-header">Purpose & Quick Summary</span>

**The purpose** of this blog post is to make available responses collected through an anonymous survey that aimed to capture experiences of early career researchers (ECRs) with an academic mentor.

In addition to preliminary visualizations of the survey responses, the post contains voices of ECRs as they describe their positive and negative experiences associated with the mentorship they have received.

You may find this article (or at least some sections of it) useful to your journey if you are,

* **A Mentor** who is advising mentees and actively thinking about how to do better
* **A Mentee** who is having a very negative or very positive experience and wondering if these experiences are common
* **Someone who is planning a career in research** and wishes to learn about experiences of others to determine what to look for in a prospective mentor
* **An administrator at an academic institution** actively thinking about how to improve mentee-mentor communication, identify potential issues in mentor/mentee relationships, and/or aim to address these shortcomings through innovative strategies.

**Visualizations in this blog post are fully reproducible** and generated by [this R markdown file](https://github.com/merenlab/mentorship-survey-workflow/blob/master/mentorship.Rmd) from the [survey results stored here](https://github.com/merenlab/mentorship-survey-workflow/blob/master/mentorship.tsv). By cloning [this repository](https://github.com/merenlab/mentorship-survey-workflow/) you can investigate the results yourself. If you are interested, you can send me a pull request on GitHub to improve the representation of the survey.

{:.warning}
**Warning**: Reading experiences of many ECRs in their own words made me realize that while the details of very positive experiences of mentees can be very uplifting, very negative experiences can be extremely difficult to go through and may trigger strong emotions. If you are an ECR, please feel free to skip quotes marked with red sections altogether. That said, I also came to the realization while I was working on this material that if you are someone who is in a position of power in academia like myself, learning about the experiences of ECRs and trying to appreciate the diversity of ways by which mentors can influence the lives and well-being of their mentees in very positive or very negative ways is nothing less than a responsibility for us.

## Introduction

<blockquote markdown="1">
**Mentor**: An experienced person who advises and helps somebody with less experience over a period of time.

Sounds straightforward enough. Yet, effective mentorship in academia is extremely difficult. If you are reading these lines, you probably already know that mentor-mentee relationships in science are not always happy and productive.

We as mentors find ourselves in positions of power with little to no preparation to understand what is expected of us or truly appreciate the impact of our actions on trainees who work with us. We as trainees do not recognize the critical importance of identifying mentors that match our needs and expectations, and the long-lasting impact of the mentorship we will receive on our well-being and careers. We all find our way over time through positive and negative experiences, but these occasionally very costly lessons rarely transcend to the next generation effectively.

A large number of resources make suggestions or offer insights into how to create a healthy research environment ([1](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006914), [2](https://hbr.org/2019/03/why-inclusive-leaders-are-good-for-organizations-and-how-to-become-one), [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05146-5)), how to be a good mentor ([4](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2017/08/24/lessons-about-mentoring-those-who-do-it-best-essay), [5](https://sfp.caltech.edu/mentors/mentoring_tips), [6](https://grad.uw.edu/for-students-and-post-docs/core-programs/mentoring/mentoring-guides-for-students/what-a-good-mentor-does/)), or how to find one ([7](https://grad.uw.edu/for-students-and-post-docs/core-programs/mentoring/mentoring-guides-for-students/finding-good-mentors/), [8](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/04/finding-mentors)). A lot of actual research has been done on the topic of mentorship, as well ([9](https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2019/03/three-research-based-lessons-improve-your-mentoring), [10](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-009-9165-3), [11](https://www.amazon.com/Faculty-Success-through-Mentoring-Education/dp/0742563200), [12](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21531235/), [13](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20431710/), [14](amazon.com/Handbook-Mentoring-Work-Research-Practice/dp/1412916690), [15](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16954490/)).

Given the existing resources that are already available both to mentors and mentees, it would have been naive to expect an anonymous survey of relatively small sample size and no research value to make a notable contribution to the pool of *suggestions* mentors and mentees are already given. Well, why this survey, then, at the expense of pretty much everyone's time?

**Existing resources for mentees and mentors typically lack voices of trainees and their experiences**. Existing resources are for sure well-written and well-curated. But they are also washed clean of emotions and turned into abstract notions and suggestions --mostly because it is extremely difficult to summarize people's experiences into categorical values. If you know any early career researcher who had a very positive or a very negative experience with a mentor, you already know that outcomes of mentor-mentee relationships are often filled with extremely deep emotions, which sometimes linger with everyone involved for much longer than the official period of the relationship.

I strongly believe that reading good and bad experiences of trainees *in their own words* with a current or a past mentor in full anonymity is one of the most effective ways to encourage current or future mentors to reflect on the real-world consequences of mentorship decisions and practices on people's lives. Thus, **the primary purpose of this article is to amplify the words I received from ECRs about their experiences with their mentors**.

On the one hand, I hope that by providing a platform for mentees, this resource will shed light on the dark and often unspoken corners of the experience spectrum in mentor-mentee relationships in academia. On the other hand, as the following survey participant wisely and eloquently puts it, perhaps it is far too naive to imagine that a real change may emerge by trying to change individual mentors who are willing to change:

<blockquote>
Rather than offering advices to mentors, I suggest that universities to re-evaluate metrics considered for tenure and promotion: down-weight big grants and journal impact factor, and place greater weight on training, support, and teaching for undergrads and grad researchers. Let you mentees anonymously review the program and professors in their department, and strive to identify gaps based on well-being surveys of grad students and address them.
<br /><br />
Common advice students are given prior to selecting a PI or program is insufficient to navigate the system.<br /><br />We need systemic change.
<div class="blockquote-author">a <b>Grad student</b> (♀) who had a <span style="color:red;">very negative experience</span> in <b>United States</b></div>
</blockquote>

I agree that it is the system that needs to change.

But even if a systemic change is the only way forward, the desire for that only comes from empathy and understanding that goes beyond bits and pieces of abstract notions of good and bad. In that vein, I hope that this article will at least serve as an additional drop in our bucket of empathy by enabling its readers to recognize the aspects of mentee experiences that are often absent in the public discussions of mentorship.

## Final words

I hope the resources on this page will inspire mentors with actionable items to improve the experiences of their mentees, mentees with green and red flags to look out for in this difficult system, and administrators with new strategies to survey mentee well-being and improve mentee-mentor relationships at their departments and/or institutions.

Before I leave you with the voices of mentees, I thank you for coming this far.
