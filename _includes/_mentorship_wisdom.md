## The words of early career researchers

### Mentees report on biggest shortcomings of their mentors

In this section you will find the words of ECRs to describe '<b>the BIGGEST SHORTCOMING of the mentorship they have received</b>' from a mentor of theirs, considering how did this shortcoming influenced their work, wellbeing, and/or career. You will see that even mentees who overall had a positive experience with their mentors suffered from some aspects of the mentorship they have received.

<blockquote>
Pitted trainees against one another, including asking them to report what others had said in confidence.<br /><br />Trainees had no control of their projects, which would often and randomly change. Expected to start drinking alcohol with mentor most days around 3pm, and still stay working in the lab until late at night/early morning. Discriminated on the basis of appearance, including refusing to introduce me to professors she considered “high profile”, and telling me she just wanted “a lab full of beautiful people”, which I was not. Said racist things to other trainees. Refused to edit grant proposals that trainees wanted to submit. Asked the chair of the department to have an NDA written, and force me to sign, stating that I would never speak about any of my experiences in the lab, when I left. I could go on.<br /><br />All of this deeply affected my well being. By the time I left, I was barely eating, or sleeping or functioning. I’m still working through the trauma, even though I am in a very supportive environment now.

<blockquote>
My mentor focuses a lot on productivity, which sometimes makes it difficult for longer projects to develop to maturity in time, and they have high expectations of experiments and results being publishable. Luckily this has been okay for me, because I would rather publish multiple, smaller projects as discrete units rather than wait for a gigantic Nature paper that contains 5+ years worth of data, but the focus on productivity can be challenging.

Vindictive. If we spoke up or in anyway questioned her behaviour we were punished. Specifically we would lose control of a project or we would be removed from a publication. In the most extreme example, an accepted paper was scrapped (withdrawn and placed in the bin so to speak) after a colleague publication questioned her behaviour.

My advisor is impatient with students and often uses abusive or derogatory language. The students shared their difficulties with me but we are all worried that starting a conversation about this with my advisor would damage our future career. In addition, my advisor is occasionally impulsive and responds in anger without making sure she are correct in her assumptions. She has threatened to remove her name from my papers and berated me in front of colleagues.

They never acknowledged that I was doing something new to the lab. While I was a graduate student, postdocs supposedly helped me, but turns out they had never done metagenomics so their input was detrimental.<br /><br />They left me off a paper I should have been on. No one did metagenomics, it was tough to learn. But at least when I did learn it, I worked on others’ projects and was excited to contribute so much... but then I was excluded from being an author.

<blockquote>
Mentor is very dependent on trainees productivity (no projects of the mentors own) for their own “success” without investing very much in the projects themselves. Papers are submitted on the agenda (timing, journal choice, preprint decisions etc) of the Mentor rather than the trainee who did 99% of the work to put it all together. This creates a dynamic where failure (papers don’t happen quickly enough) is entirely the fault of the trainee but success (recognition, credit) is shared with the mentor regardless of involvement or contributions to the project.

Chaotic mind. Too many ideas that weren't organized well, into practice. Was frustrating at times to try manage them, and pick up the brilliant ones among the garbage. Trait contributed to mentor being unreliable due to schedule mix ups. Trait contributed to overwhelming amount of work for me and other trainees.<br /><br />On the other hand, trait forced me to be way more organized, and influenced my need for and implementation of structure and planning in my current position.

Completely hands off, could not provide ANY training, was immature and inappropriate. I had to figure every single thing out on my own and establish basic things like the safety binder (required), undergraduate research group, lab equipment and consumables. I had zero training. My PI was never able to address any of my concerns or take them seriously.<br /><br />My PI had a large startup fund but refused to fund a GSR. I never received a letter of rec for funding and job applications. It was a stressful and obnoxious time. I was not able to find a postdoc or position and am contracting sort of to make ends meet.

Not being familiar with the field: he added an additional field after becoming a Professor, but doesn't have any practical experience, nor keeps up to date with the literature, fully depends on his PhD students to keep him informed, which can be anoying Not putting deadlines: might seem easy-going (which it is), but that makes me feel pressured to finish everything asap instead of in a fixed timeframe Avoiding conflicts: obviously this can be positive, but sometimes it would be appropriate to make people aware of their shortcomings, unreasonable behaviour, them avoiding their responsibilities, etc.

Not being available/not having time. It influence my work tremendously as I need to wait for simple feedback from a paper which I work hard on approximately 2 months (asking many times meanwhile, "please, read my manuscript, I'm waiting").<br /><br />In my workplace code of conduct would be more than welcome, but for the PI to develop it, he/she would have to have at least minimum of self criticism which is not the case.

Lack of mental health awareness and empathy: my mentor had no mental health awareness. To her, nothing was more important than herself. She once pushed a fellow student into having a panic attack in the middle of a meeting, banned us from going after her to make sure she was fine and complained that it was a waste of her time. This created a very unhealthy environment in which we felt that we were a burden and could not tell her our personal problems that could affect our performance. She wouldn't listen: any concerns about her mentoring style raised by us or any other faculty members was taken by her as a personal attack. As a PhD student, my project suggestions were either ignored or deemed "rubbish" (as she would say). She almost enjoyed publicly shaming people. Long-term, it made me afraid of asking questions at talks and seminars and destroyed my confidence. Not aware of my career development needs: we had a form to help us identify career development needs and raise problems. The form was submitted to the graduate school every month. She often changed the contents of my form to what she thought was good for me without actually listening to me first. She even stopped me from going to visit another researcher's lab to generate preliminary data for a fellowship application, because it was not useful to her research (yes, she explicitly asked me what the benefit was to her research). By the end of my PhD, she told me that she was unhappy about me going to job interviews, because there was no benefit to her and asked for a deduction on my allowance for the days I wasn't working for her. I was completely demotivated and lost my love for science because of this behaviour. It was pushing me away from wanting a career in science. The only reason why I took my current job as a postdoc was to get away from her, but it has helped me rediscover my love for science.

Lack of support in scientific development of the project. While this can be a conscious decision in mentoring a graduate student, the strategy was never explicitly stated, which caused a lot of trouble for me in the first two years of my work. In fact before starting, when I asked about the level of support I will have I was told a that their relationship with their students is very close. Possibly this was the case before I joined, but turned out the relationship was minimal for me and others who joined after me.

Lack of time. As a full professor and responsible for a big group the one-to-one meetings were limited to ~1 hour per month. In my opinion this is too little for a new student and resulted in delays or stagnation in the first months of my PhD Lack of a concrete plan/ time-schedule. Although I am extremely happy I was allowed to have control of my project and make my own choices along the way, not setting concrete goals and milestones made me at different moments fell lost No support/interest on skills/progress other than the scientific ones. Although my mentor is giving the space and time to follow courses or take part on other initiatives/projects that will<br /><br />give us experience other than the scientific one, this was never planned or driven by them. That meant I had to figure out on my own what I should follow, feeling that many times I did not take the right decisions or I did not take advantage of all opportunities

I felt that sometimes she wanted to be correct and was not taking part in problems happening in the laboratory, and left it to us (PostDocs) to solve them. But, in several cases, it would have been better if she would have stepped in.<br /><br />She was very busy, but always felt time for us. However, the lack of personal-working life balance was not a role model for newies starting in the lab. She knew her shortcoming and ask us not to follow her behaviour, but at the same time the message she was projecting was "you will succeed if you invest crazy hours on your work". Sometimes I was feeling bad if I did not invest those hours, although I knew I didn't want that life, so stopped myself from doing it.

Unwilling to give control of any part of the project to trained staff. I am unable to improve my skills when writing manuscripts, and have lost self esteem with my ability to conduct research properly. I am always struggling to keep up my research to the speed of the demands he sets for data. I constantly feel like I am under performing and not trusted as a scientist to design, run and interpret experiments. Unwilling to listen to criticism. I do not feel that I could raise concerns without effects on my career and wellbeing in the lab. Therefore no changes are made. Unable to give constructive criticism of work. I dread writing and editing work with him. Instead of giving clear feedback to parts he is unhappy with, he will use phrases like "this looks rushed" "this needs more work" and is then unable to clarify what about the work he is unhappy with. This makes me feel that I am failing or not working hard enough.

Maybe we are more of a mismatch than it is his shortcoming, in the beginning of my PhD I felt very lost and overwhelmed since I came from a different field and my PhD topic was not defined at all. I would have wished for more support, conversations, and help narrowing down that topic. In general I feel like I'm mostly on my own and I don't feel like I can talk to him about problems or concerns that I'm having. Also he is very blunt and I have been on the receiving end of sexist and offensive jokes (also in the company of other people) multiple times. This left me feeling powerless and angry since I believed that I can't say how this offends me since he's my superior.

Not recognizing or attributing credit for ideas that come from below (i.e. grad students, postdocs) and over-weighting and over crediting ideas and opinions that come from above (i.e. other professors). While I have been able to pursue my own ideas, they were met with a great deal of resistance, and I've had to stand up for myself on numerous occasions. A less strong-willed person may have just given up, only done what was being directly asked, and also received less authorship credit as a result. However, this lack of support and credit has resulted in my own imposter syndrome.<br /><br />A secondary shortcoming was micromanaging to the point of causing stress, which reduced research productivity.

Extreme favoritism toward certain members of the group. This blinded him to issues that the other people in the group were having and any complaints about his favorite people. Over time he stopped meeting with his graduate students and was most focused on one postdoc. I was doing exceptional work as a postdoc at the time, leading all of my own projects, getting grants and a science paper, and felt totally unappreciated and ignored. He didn't have time for me (the most productive member of the group), and didn't have time for anyone but his favorite people. This was extremely damaging and drove some people who worked for him out of science all together. For me personally I made a point to claim my work more and play this behavior off as him not being involved in my work. I also had to spend a lot of my time mentoring all of the graduate students that he was ignoring. This was a good experience for me to learn how to mentor, but I probably lost about a year of work over the course of my postdoc having to do things that I felt were my PIs job.

IMO, his biggest shortcoming was being too passively involved in the lab's science. It didn't impact me as a postdoc, but many of the junior grad students floundered more than was necessary. At first I thought his lack of involvement was neglect, but after discussions realized that it was a conscious choice motivated by his view of the importance of "independence." There may have been some merit to that idea, but I still think that some of the students struggled more than was necessary in a way that soured them on academic science.

But then he never followed any of those guidelines. I think he didn’t read them at all or he forgot.<br /><br />He is pretty controlling about what I do for my research but then is not available to get them done.

Micromanaging/power concerns: I was encouraged to develop my own ideas in conjunction with my mentor, but was limited from implementing those ideas even after approval by being told that my mentor was in charge / I could not "waste" my mentor's resources. I would regularly be told that I was not as experienced so "could not be trusted" with level appropriate tasks. Even after earning grant funds, I was prevented from using lab resources to implement ideas that were approved by my mentor.<br /><br />Lack of attention: Regularly makes recommendations that are not in line with my interests/goals, makes comments for projects that are not in line with the projects' interests/goals, and loses track of project aims/deadlines in ways that are detrimental for the project completion<br /><br />Lack of boundaries: Regularly contacted outside of normal work hours, insisted that people work on weekends and holidays.

My present PI is someone I had dreamed of working for and highly respected. With that being said, I am in the process of changing labs because of the toxic atmosphere promoted, lack of guidance offered, and poor planning/communication.<br /><br />Toxic atmosphere: The toxic environment is strongly linked to the enforcement of a hierarchical structure--but repeatedly we were told we were a team. As a new student in the lab I was turned in for disrespect, but when I asked what I had done no one would tell me. When I attempted to defend myself, my PI told me "You are not equal to anyone. You are to respect senior students. You can not defend this. You are the dirt." This conversation has stayed with me, and her statement that she would Master Me Out if things did not change (even though I was not told what needed to change). The senior student has since discussed that day with me and told me that our PI was getting mad at her for lack of progress, to save her own skin that day she chose to redirect our PI's anger to me. With my PI's short temper also comes unpredictable times of kindness, this pattern is mirrored by the senior students. Empathy for the events of life was also not present in this lab. Other students said this was because our PI had been chair and had seen what could go wrong when a PI knew their students past their results. The potential of having an interaction that tore down my self worth/confidence/happiness while being required to be present every day regardless of not having wet lab work to do or any space to do computer work caused me to dread lab--somewhere that had previously been the highlight of my day.<br /><br />Lack of guidance: My PI relies exclusively on senior students teaching newer students for the first few years of their PhD. When I began my time in the lab I was assigned an organism that was new to the lab and a question. This project was not something anyone in the lab had done before, so no one knew what I should be doing (but they didn't say that in front of our PI out of fear or pride I'll never know). In the past a first project is passed down from a student who has graduated--so a basic heading is already lined out. I resorted to contacting another PI for a life line (I asked for advice on how to speak with my new PI and any advice they had for starting from scratch), this was a direct result of my new PI traditionally not speaking to students until after candidacy. When my PI did give me guidance, it was often accompanied by heavy critique of my ability to complete a PhD. or be published (even though I was the most published grad student in the lab), assay suggestions that she recanted and was upset that I had completed, and the ever present warning of being kicked out.<br /><br />Planning/Communication: Lab meetings and individual meetings are not planned. We had been told we would have a meeting once a week as a lab. This was kept up for a few weeks, but then they became less common and notice of a lab meeting would be 10 minutes before. Tardiness was not tolerated, which was fine until I was stood up for the 4th time in two months for our individual meeting. The rules of the lab were not provided to new grad and undergrad students or made available in the lab. I had to email my PI 3 times and verbally request the rules/expectations during a lab meeting before I received them--I had been in the lab for 5 months at that point.

Differentiating our academic contributions- It is difficult to be a postdoc (with aspirations to become an assistant professor) with an assistant professor as a mentor.

"Time management" or responsiveness. It can be difficult to communicate with my adviser as he is very busy, and more than once he has not showed up to a scheduled meeting or significantly delayed returning edits based on his own timetable. I have missed a couple of deadlines as a result, but in general it mostly requires me to plan accordingly and expect projects to take longer.

I think my mentor sometimes does not see that small changes in the way his trainees are able to work (work from home (this was before corona), work strange working times like from 11-19, having a second desktop etc) can really help them perform better and make their lives much easier and less stressful. In my opinion it would not really change anything for him and I don't always understand why he does not like or allows for such changes. He is a super relaxed dude, but sometimes with these small things he can be quite determined and not open for discussions.<br /><br />He is just a really busy guy and always says that he can make time for his trainees, however as much as I appreciate him saying that, its just not true. I know he wants to make more time for us and less to politics and management, but sometimes he just has to be realistic and not get our hopes up.

- Arrogance: My mentor was so self confident that he knows everything, that he has never read papers I asked him to take a look. These publications were the basis of my arguments to write the discussion of my paper. - Incompetence in the field: My PI was specialist of quantitative genetics while my thesis was about RNA-Seq. He never helped me technically or entrusted me to someone competent.

His main issue was that he was detached and disengaged. He was largely absent from the lab and deliberately ignored personnel issues. There were serious conflicts and sexual harassment that he witnessed and was told about, but mostly did not intervene and once retaliated against a complainant. I did not have scheduled meetings with him, and he did not want to set up regular meetings. I often felt like I was bothering him if I went to talk to him, so I completely stopped communicating with him and spent lots of time spinning my wheels. He only learned about research findings when I presented them in lab meeting, about 3 times a year.

My PI is almost completely uninterested and uninvolved in my project(s). It is entirely up to me to design and execute my projects, analyze the data and come to a neat and tidy conclusion before I show him anything. The same is true of drafting figures and manuscripts, if I bring him anything than a polished finished product to review he completely loses his mind and screams at me. My PI fancys himself a profoundly skilled mentor, but I have seen none of this mentorship. I'm lucky to meet with him 1-on-1 twice a year, and he is not shy about being openly hostile or ignoring any email, draft, or meeting request. I don't think it is an accident that he spends most of his mentorship time and energy on the attractive young female grad students and post docs in the lab, who whom he regularly makes inappropriate comments and jokes.

For the first two years I had a volatile mentor with highs and lows. Was only supportive of my career when it benefitted him. He would insist on writing copious review paper in controversial areas not relevant to his expertise. He was abusive to me but more so to others in the lab. He was flirtatious with younger female students and lecturers. If they were not nice to him he would find ways to stunt their careers. However, he would also be very kind on other days. Sounds confusing? It did to me too. Eventually he got worse, become head of the department, and had a breakdown all in the space of 6 months. I helped him during this time. I helped him receive his diagnosis of bipolar disorder. He still works as head of the department and still has these episodes, but less frequently. Unfortunately, this experience still impacts my career. I have a tonne of review papers that are of mediocre quality, the mentor keeps contacting me to try publish controversial topics in relation to covid now because it is topical and a postdoc that worked in the same lab as me has since become a lecturer in that department and acts the exact same way as the mentor... However, I left the lab, joined an Ivy League school and my future is brighter as a postdoc under a great mentor.

The biggest shortcoming would be the constant negative feedback (i.e. telling me outright that I am not good enough, not doing things quickly enough, and that my work/project is less important to her than others in my group).<br /><br />Over the last 6 years this behavior has really made me question whether or not I am good enough to be successful in science, and has ultimately changed my career trajectory.<br /><br />When I began this postdoc position, I was certain I would stay (or at least try to) stay in academia, but after the 'mentorship' I have received in my current position I will most likely end up in the government/industry/start up sector instead. Another shortcoming would be her constant need to micromanage every aspect of my work.<br /><br />As a postdoc, I expected to have more freedom in my research and collaborative endeavors, but she simply treats me (and the other postdocs in the group) the same as the PhD students.<br /><br />This has really thwarted my growth as a scientist, and is also one of the contributing factors as to why I will likely leave academia at the end of my contract.

There are two things: the lack of transparency between him and his lab members and his lack of priority to put mentorship and student career/scientific development.<br /><br />I think the first example is lab specific but our lab do not know why a data is critical at a given moment and why something must be investigate at a particular point. We don't really know all the grants we have been trying to apply as well. The second is where my mentor has a very company minded system where everyone works for the same goal scientifically but this is coming to a point where a lot of students are falling out of the cracks because of his mindset.

Conflicting messages leading to gaslighting and distrust in self / ability / work etc.<br /><br />My advisor is rarely available for hands-on guidance because of other "higher priority work" (though I am their only grad student). I end up learning how to do much of the work on my own, which is slow, and I can be reasonably timid to start because of the difficulty and cost in acquiring our samples. My advisor will frequently pressure me to move faster with lab work and critique me for not taking enough initiative towards research. However, when I do things on my own, my direction and efforts are heavily critiqued for not having forethought, and the subsequent execution of the work involves a lot of micromanagement (down to which text editor I use on my own time). For example, I sought help from someone else because my advisor wasn't available to teach me how to do something new and doing it on my own was "too slow". When my advisor found out I asked for help, they said that "me seeking outside help undermines their work and ability to mentor".<br /><br />The messaging from this type of advising has been that I cannot be trusted or do that right thing, and there is no space or opportunity for making mistakes and learning -- no margin of error. I have been critiqued for being too much of a perfectionist and also for being too lazy -- depends on the day. I don't ever know how I stand with them. It feels as if they don't consider me as a whole person or my work in totality, but only mentor when it is convenient for them / their self image. I find it really exhausting to constantly adjust myself to meet their newest standpoint. I don't feel encouraged to be my own scientist, have my own direction or rationale if I am not supported by my advisor in doing so.

Injustice.

His flexibility in mentoring (style, expectations, structure) meant there were some inequities that occurred between trainees. I was funded by a merit-based fellowship open to first-generation, low-income students and those from underrepresented minority groups. Because of this, I was never funded by a specific grant which meant I was not the "go-to" student to receive opportunities through a project or grant. Overall, this meant that I was very independent in my work and expectations, and I still was able to achieve much of what I hoped. However, it was difficult for me to collaborate as usually other students were give that extra analysis to do or samples to collect through their RAs. As a result, all the other trainees were included as co-authors in at least one manuscript during their PhDs, while the only manuscripts I participated in were ones in which I was the lead author. I could have pushed harder to be included, but this is quite difficult when you're not technically a part of the project and the other PIs don't view you as a priority.

It's hard for me to choose only one shortcoming! Perhaps the inconsistency of mentorship would cover the broad range poor performance exhibited by the mentor I am thinking of - she ranged from laissez-faire to authoritarian; would-be friendly to emotionally abusive. The negative outcome of this person on my life is hard to overstate. I developed crippling anxiety and clinical depression (perhaps I have a vulnerability to these mental health issues, but my experience with her definitely brought them out in full force), and I was unable to continue the PhD program I started with her as a mentor. I struggled through a prolonged period of precariousness but eventually moved to a new city and completed a PhD elsewhere, then secured my top-choice postdoc.

My mentor hindered my career development by trying to convince me that I "deserved" to become faculty at a top-tier research-focused institution, even though I repeated stated that I did not want to work in that type of place. My career aspirations and the jobs I wanted to apply for were never "good enough" for me, which my mentor used as an excuse to put very little effort into helping me in my job search. This was also a strategy to keep me in lab longer--if you publish one more paper, your CV will match your actual potential. But it was always, "just one more year, one more paper" without the support to actually accomplish the work.

In my opinion, the biggest shortcomming was the portrayed lack of interest and invested time. I joined the group via add-on funding and did not feel very included into the group nor that I received feedback, guidance or relevant mentoring for my career. This made me feel frustrated and even depressed at times. Only by building a supportive network of my own, via other postdocs and former mentors, I overcame this lack of interest and mentoring to proceed my career in academia.

The ability to estimate how much time is needed for certain experiments or analyses (in general), especially for newbies that do not have developed a routine (in particular). For me this meant that I had to defend being late on delivering a result, a figure, or a manuscript section, which is not exactly a motivational boost.

Although I indicated that my PI meets with me now, this was not true for most of my PhD. My PI's overall mentorship style has been to not mentor much until the end of the PhD. Overall, this fits with the approach of "welcome to the lab, here's a bench, let me know when you are ready to submit a paper" that is common in PhD training. We spend a lot of time spinning our wheels when this happens as we don't have the experience to know how to be successful in early years. This fails to address the need of a PhD student to be mentored and trained at critical stages where they need to learn confidence from experienced success in the thesis lab. Failure to help a student build up their early years leads to a lack of confidence and focus and contributes to the depression and mental health issues that are common among PhD students. This also leads to students falling behind peers that have mentors investing in them regularly and leads us to have very long PhDs, which negatively impacts our careers and mental health.

My mentor was interested in a very limited set of trajectories (grad school -> postdoc -> R1 or field-specific research institute) for his students and postdocs and was only equipped to advise in that small range. He recognized that he didn't have the expertise outside of that path, but he seemed to think and sometimes stated that he was more supportive outside of that pipeline than he was. This is a pattern across multiple trainees that I know of, but what this looked like for me: we established relatively early in my time working with him that I was interested in teaching positions and would do what I needed to pursue that, including teaching and *not* doing research over the summer after my third year. This came up regularly in our discussions of planning for the future. Later, he attempted to persuade me to put this off until the summer after fourth year (the summer directly preceding when I would be on the market, which I thought was too late). I did not put it off and did teach that summer, but I also did unpaid research work because of pressure/expectations from him. He was also supportive to a very limited extent of the teaching I did in the following few semesters, stating that he knew it was helpful for me but largely regarding it as a distraction. He helped when I was on the market as much as he could -- wrote rec letters/served as a reference, read over my research statement to check for reasonableness -- but that was also pretty limited (though again, that limitation he at least recognized). However, he then tried to use my success on the job market to talk another trainee, interested in industry internships, into staying on an academic trajectory. Overall, I ended up feeling like I wasn't the student he wanted or hoped for and that if I hadn't been on my own outside funding, he would not have let me pursue the opportunities that directly led me to a good position for me. It didn't feel like I could really talk about the work I was interested in with any amount of detail because it was so outside of his frame of reference and was part of what he thought was distracting me from my research. He never really saw or appreciated the *work* I did because I didn't think he would value it.

Unpredictability and lack of consistency. It is very difficult to know if my mentor is going to respond positively or negatively to an data, idea, a collaboration, or a method. This often changes too, where initially they will be extremely negative about an idea, but then later be enthusiastic about it. Or will not show any interest in being active in a collaboration, and then will be upset that they are not kept in the loop. It is very difficult for me to understand if I am doing well or doing poorly because of this mercurial style of engagement. It makes me far less likely to engage the mentor at all because this behavior is confusing and makes me uncomfortable.

This PI used the "break you down to build you back up" technique, without building you back up and generated an overall toxic lab environment. All feedback was on your shortcomings. This PI also built up (metaphorical) barriers in the lab to labmates supporting each other: the PI would speak negatively of other trainees in the lab to other members of the lab behind their backs. If you tried to defend a lab member, the PI would accuse you of the same shortcomings of that lab member, or of being too stupid to notice them. This PI made racist and ableist comments to other members of the lab. This PI told me, that I was taking her feedback too personally if I questioned it at all - no matter how I reacted to it. Overall this PI has made me lose trust in a lot of academia. This PI makes me forever worried that if a lab tries to recruit me, they are only putting up a front of being nice until I get into that lab, because in this PI's lab, I was treated as the "Golden Child" during my rotation, until I got tossed aside after joining.

I'd say the fact that he doesn't give me feedback is my main negative comment. I've tried asking but I think it's his personality. He's very kind and probably worried of coming across as rude when giving negative feedback. He does give positive feedback.

I am talking about my PhD. experience, as currently Im a Pandemic-PostDoc-working-from-home.<br /><br />Power balance. The first concern of my mentor was to establish dominance, no matter the subject or the implications, the important thing was to have the last word, control and define the final decision. This translates to shutdown any idea or suggestion raised by a trainee for the hell of it and exert dominance. Sadly, because of this, I had to learn to manipulate the way I presented the idea, so she felt it was her idea and that she was in control and I had the result that I wanted as well. Hence, everybody was dysfunctionally happy.<br /><br />The other thing is that she is more involved with the politics and project administration, so the scientific part fall to a secondary place, resulting in errors that grow and grow and grow, which could have been detected much earlier if she would worry more about the scientific part. Luckily for me, she was very open for collaborations and Im not shy at all and I had good relationships with many other professors, so I knocked many doors and got a lot of help/guidance (not the case at all for most of my fellow trainees).

Communication. Since I was the only foreigner at the group, not only cultural differences but also I have different “common sense” with the other team members. Once one behavior that I thought was normal turned out hurting badly my mentor which made him almost gave up to be my mentor. It was the hardest time in my graduate study period because I didn’t think I made any mistake. After several mediations, we finally made up and learned on how to communicate better between each other. That’s why I received specific mentorship compared to other members. But, after we found our best way to communicate, I ended up working for him in total of 9 years, PhD and Postdoc. Even until now, 2,5 years after I moved from academia, and I work in industry, we still communicate and have collaboration for some projects.

- She did not know how to say no, and she was involved (and involved their trainees) to too much projects, generating unecessary stress. - She did not know how to put limits, so some trainees had few work while others were doing too much work. This generated a bad environment, were some of us felt overwelhmed and others felt ignored by her. - She was not a planner, so it was an usual thing to write your abstract for a conference the very last day or to submit your bureaucracy (even in weekends). - She was not an expert of my specific project, so sometimes it became very challenging and I had to teach myself a lot. I learnt by failing, which can get very frustrating and depressing. This made me feel very unconfortable presenting new results, since I was always thinking something was wrong for sure.

Priorities of PI with regard to publishing does not align with the needs of ECRs. As an ECR, it is frustrating and detrimental to your career working four years for the one high impact publication that your PI wants but that does not get published within the time frame of your PhD or PostDoc leaving you with no publication at all.<br /><br />Constant extension of deadlines for feedback, manuscript revisions, official reports etc. by the PI can cause huge disrupts in motivation even for the most motivated ECRs. PIs might think in time frames of 10-20 years with their permanent position, however, ECRs often have to think in time frames of 1-5 years, in which constant two week extensions even of simple tasks is just stressful. The feeling of lacking reliability and accountability and the loss of self-efficacy because no matter how hard the ECR works, projects and manuscripts are not progressing, are the reasons why these waiting periods are so demotivating.<br /><br />When the PI is rather laissez-faire with the internal leading style with regard to the daily work, project management etc. but on the other hand wants to control every detail of what is leaving the lab, this can cause a imbalance between extremely high freedom and responsibility but very little control on the outcome, e.g. which projects will actually be published or are just cancelled. This is frustrating because on a daily basis, ECRs can feel lost and without direction but even when they grow up to the task and become their "own leader", they cannot actually make the important decisions or have only very little say in it.<br /><br />Many ECRs in my group have not had 1-to-1 discussions with the top PI in most years being in the lab. This helps the spread of rumours and misunderstanding because the ECRs depend on somebody who they do not really know so even small things that are said can easily be misinterpreted. Of course, ECRs could ask for more meetings, however, if this is not encouraged from the PI side, only outgoing ECRs would actually request meetings. More importantly, if the PI is rarely present and also hard to schedule a meeting with (or meetings get postponed) because they are busy with other committees, mentees outsides the lab, etc. ECRs easily get the impression that they (and their work) do not matter.

My mentor is (and has been) often absent for long periods, and then when he has a concern, he is overwhelming in his criticism and doomsday about it. He personalizes his concerns at times to me- e.g., makes assumptions about my motivations or decision-making without asking and without listening to what I have to say- e.g., this problem arose because you don't care (no, I asked you for help because I do care). He often does not provide proactive mentorship, rather reactive mentorship, which leads to issues being prolonged unnecessarily. He expects me to be able to anticipate a problem or know a solution that he has not ever communicated to me.

My mentor was unaccountable, nobody could touch him or check his actions. Not his peers, not the internal policies and not the law as it seemed - he was a very big fish with a lot of power and little to lose.<br /><br />His only fear was with political correctness and scandals - which actually made him treating males much worse than females. Does not matter what happened and regardless of proof - males would always be wrong in any conflict with a female.<br /><br />He and his PI would fail miserably in keeping us informed and safe regarding our future contracts. People would always be left on a limbo regarding renovations of contract until the very last moment. On the other hand, many colleagues were promised to have their contracts renewed just to be told they wouldn't also with short notice.<br /><br />My mentor had a long carreer and some enemies which attacked me and some collegues. Bullied and mobbed us, inside and outside my work place. Blackmailed people around me to get away. The mentor was aware of the situation and could understand better than me at the time that it was not my fight. The mentor knew it was one agression against him and have NEVER move a single finger to protect us. Actually, my previous mentor have<br /><br />never got involved in any sort of conflict solving role - which me and my colleagues lacked many times. When he would be involved, it would be to put all parts involved down and threat everybody.<br /><br />In fact, perhaps the main trait regardin my mentor's attitude towards most of my colleagues (and me) was indiscriminate distrust. Unbearable in the long run.<br /><br />I was never asked about a single feedback about my work environment, about my colleagues, about my mentors, about the institutional policies. There is absolutely no way to improve without feedbacks.

But base on my previous decision during my PhD, I have less publication now although I know I could have published all the 6 chapters in my thesis.

Due to his psychopathic behaviour, my methal health went down the drain, resulting in me calling in sick. After which my contract was terminated on bogus grounds.<br /><br />He was terrible at communication. He didn’t communicate essential information to me, while other PhD students in the department who worked for other Pi’s did get that information. He worked on some of my projects without letting me know what he wanted to do on them. Resulting in me and him doing the same work. Priorities of the projects I worked on would change almost weekly. The project that was the highest priority one week would not matter the next week, and the following week it would be the most important project again.<br /><br />The working conditions established by my mentor were toxic. For example, he would email and call me from 8 am to 11 pm and did not respect my weekends. He would plan meeting on official days of and expected me to work on days of and he denied me any vacations. He expected me to solve research problems in an afternoon while the entire PhD projects were devoted to that problem without success. He sneakily manipulated me on numerous occasions. He would promise me a lot without ever living up to his promises. He did not tolerate me speaking up against his behaviour and actively fought against me when I tried to find and get help to improve the working conditions.<br /><br />My mentor did not respect my employment contract. I was supposed to follow courses as part of my doctorate training. I wanted to follow courses on the subject of my dissertation and work on my didactic skills. But mentor found courses to be a waste of time and money and he was not willing to invest in me. My contract stated a 38-hour working week but on average, it ended up at ~60-hour working weeks during my time there<br /><br />To top it all, my mentor did not have the required skills to supervise me on a majority of my PhD project<br /><br />When my contract was terminated I contacted the previous PhD students of my mentor to ask what their experiences with him. Luckily or sadly depending on how you look at it, their experiences were not better than my experiences with him. It saddens me that the university doesn’t do anything about this kind of behaviour.

The kind of “what will they think” attitude so I never really felt secure or confident in my own work. I also stopped trusting her feedback altogether because I know it was a matter of time for it to change to what someone else on my committee thought.

Lack of providing proper guidance along the PhD path. As an incoming graduate student I had very little knowledge of how to be a graduate student and going to a prestigious school I felt intimidated to ask for the help I needed. For most of my PhD years (8 years), I was the only student in our lab, which was very isolating and I was discouraged from getting technical help from other labs with necessary expertise. We also only had "group" meetings once or twice a year, which means there I wasn't pushed to be accountable for my time.

My mentor was focused on what's best for him (some may argue for science in general) by focusing on big papers, which took years to produce. Everything what was not NSC was not good enough. That did not mean that it was possible to simply do the projects and publish. We were not allowed to publish if the papers were not on NSC level. It took me 4 years to have a single publication from my postdoc and I could only do it because I left the group. Lack of publications from the postdoc, inability to show productivity, almost costed me my research career. It has put >50% of researchers working with this mentor out of the academia.

Mentorship style appeared very hands off, but in reality was highly controlling. He allowed freedom in defining research projects but discouraged some collaborations strongly and wanted credit (as coauthor and proposal co-I) for mentees work. Also controlled access to and scheduling for laboratory, technical support, and analytical equipment. Discouraged seeking additional mentors at our institution, eliminating mentees ability to seek outside help. Retaliated against criticism. Sexually harassed and bullied to assert his dominance over his mentees and supervises.

My 'mentor' was the acting department head who had risen to the position based on his seniority and the lack of permanent head, but had very little technical knowledge about anything related to genetics.<br /><br />He shipped me off to my co-supervisor and only showed up when we had a publication ready to be submitted. He then had conflicts with my co-supervisor over the people he wanted to include as gift authors and even threatened to sabotage my papers and my thesis if my co-supervisor didn't acquiesce to his demands. So in short biggest shortcomings: shamelessness, inflated ego, bullying.

Not recognizing emotionally difficult situations and supporting me through them. For example when I was scooped we never talked about it beyond strategically what to do next.

Ironically, my advisor prided herself on her mentoring and on being supportive, but she did not do this for me because people always perceive me as very confident.

They were extremely negative about any potential projects I suggested or when I made statements about the work I was doing (I.e. telling me my ideas were bad and wouldn't get funded). They once laughed openly with others at a hypothesis I made about a project (which later turned out to be correct). My PhD advisor had been extremely supportive, so I lost most of my confidence in myself fairly quickly. This continues to affect me more than 5 years later. They then threw me under the bus for a job and have spoken very negatively about me to others. I work in a very small subfield and felt completely betrayed by people I thought were my friends. I still have trust issues as a direct result.<br /><br />Zero skills transfer. This one speaks for itself and has made job hunting much harder.

He is good to talk about life things with and he is very patient. Any time I have had personal things, like medical problems, he has been so kind and understanding and has no problem with me taking time off for myself.<br /><br />He was up front about how he will not stand for sexism and therefore I felt like I could go to him. Before we traveled to our first conference together, he told me that I could come to him if I experienced sexism from anyone at the conference. He did this unprompted, which made me feel like he really “gets it”

She is flexible and accommodating, understanding that everyone has different life experiences - for example I had a family member in a far away state become sick and ultimately die while I was in the lab, and she actively encouraged me to be present as often as I could and take time off, and she shielded me from any negative work consequences.<br /><br />She truly supports you in achieving your goals, no matter what they are. She sees her main role as helping you attain whatever career goals you have, and she really means that - lots of people say that but don't truly mean it, and she does.<br /><br />She maintains long term relationships with former mentees and continues to informally mentor long after they have moved on.<br /><br />She provides structured feedback sessions so no one ever slips through the cracks - everyone meets 1 hour every 2 weeks or half hour once a week. This is despite a super packed schedule<br /><br />She fights for her trainees - we primarily do computational biology and often collaborate with people who see our work as secondary. She consistently promotes us, and often makes deals where her mentees are first or cofirst authors, and she gives up the last author position (potentially to her personal detriment)

My mentor is not very hands on, acting more as an advisor than a commander.

She worried a lot when there were exams, defenses, presentations or deadlines.

She liked to read and review the writing together with the trainee and give corrections and recommendations discussing "in live action" not word marked/comments.

My mentor always made me feel more excited about science by the time I came out of a meeting, even if I had gone in feeling down or confused. -My mentor did check in about how students were doing on a personal level and definitely encouraged work-life balance, in part by modeling it herself (not working weekends, not constantly checking emails, having lab get-togethers, etc.)

My PI's ability to zoom out has always been extremely helpful. When working on the actual analyses, going down all the rabbit holes of tiny details, it sometimes becomes very hard to see the bigger picture. With more experience in the field, my PI does an excellent job in connecting the dots, building up storylines, and seeing the significance of single results for the broader field.<br /><br />Once the ECR established a good connection with the PI by requesting regular meetings, explaining results that were unclear, sharing career plans, etc., the PI actually provides helpful support and good advice.

My mentor was smart, knew a lot the literature and would always have relevant scientific criticism and suggestions. My mentor always guaranteed that I would not be working on excessively risky projects. In fact, all my PhD and subsequent postdoc projects succeeded in great measure also because of his inputs and supervision.<br /><br />I had a lot o freedom to propose new experiments and analysis. Most importantly, my mentor have never complained or repremended me because of errors, mistakes and poor desicions. On the contrary, he would only get pissed off if I could not answer something I was expected to know the answer - which for me is a very respectful and professional way of doing science.<br /><br />I also had no issues with direct funding of my research.

Although I had no publications back then, I publish today with such easiness and I am sure it is because he took time to actually teach me and let me discover my potential.

Because my mentor was not able to make personnel decisions on his own, the entire group participated in deciding on new recruiting.

### Mentees advise their mentors to do better

In this section you will find the words of ECRs to describe the advice they would have given to their mentor so they could do better.

Ask mentees for feedback more often (even once a year is better than never), and reflect on how to suit the needs of your trainees. Communicate, and ASK your trainees how you can meet their needs / if they have any specific needs and goals to achieve success.

Recognize the urgency that today’s post docs feel in regards to finding permanent jobs. Allow them to have full agency over when and where their work is presented and published (of course with feedback if there are issues that need to be fixed first)..this may not seem important to you, but for a postdoctoral who is job hunting a delay of even a month can mean the difference between sending job applications with papers to show for your post docs years, and job apps with limited productivity to show. As much as possible consider using preprints and similar to allow post docs to show their work sooner.

Just to be more involved in the science. It's definitely a tricky balance, where the mentor should provide feedback and guidance but not be overbearing or micromanaging, but I think he erred in not being involved enough.<br /><br />Another thing that I think could have been handled better, but is also tricky, is managing conflict between people within the lab. This type of conflict can poison the atmosphere and destroy morale. I think he could have done a better job of intervening and maneuvering the problem-causing individuals out of the lab...

Say no to things, including prospective students. Do not spread your self too thin. Of course it is hard to say no and we want to offer scientific training to all who are interested, because what we are doing is cool and important. However, it is better to say no to a student and allow them to find a different path than to bring them into a situation where you can not adequately devote the time/resources to properly train them (funding is not the only limiting resource).

Life happens on Life's terms. When life events happen to your grad students, some need more support than saying "you aren't trying hard enough". A phrase as small as "hang in there" can really help during hard times away from loved ones, even if you don't want to know them personally.<br /><br />Reliance on older grad students to teach the younger ones can be effective when you have a cohesive team with a variety of experiences who want to help and share. However, relying on 2 grad students (one of which is a second year) to teach new students is not effective and can lead to interpersonal problems as well as procedural issues (short cuts, bad lab etiquette,<br /><br />waste of time and resources, etc.).

In general, I would adviser prospective mentors to reflect continually on what they see the purpose of their interactions with their mentees to be, and how their specific words and actions are functioning to align with their goals for their mentees. Mentors fulfill a few specific roles: they help the mentee understand the landscape they are navigating so that they can in time come to make more decisions on their own about how to navigate it. Interactions that help the mentee to understand the 'why' behind decisions and the options they have available are in my book good interactions. Questionable interactions would probably include ones in which the mentor starts with the primary goal of 'putting the mentee in her place' or proving that the mentor has some good quality (moral high ground, superior knowledge). It's ok to default to 'when in doubt, leave it out': if you're uncertain about why you're saying something to a mentee, consider not saying it. Careless words can have consequences for your mentee's wellbeing and can also confuse the mentee as to what your priorities are, if what you really meant as the take-home message is hidden in a jumble of off-hand comments.

Help to implement and enforce a set of expectations and standards for management of trainees in the department or school that focuses on trainee career development and overall lab culture health. There is no system in place to manage the manager of trainees that I'm aware of. This is partially why PhD students struggle so much and why toxic PIs persist. Implement a regular review process for PIs who are serving as graduate and postdoc mentors in the department. This could include a review of the PI by their peers at every annual review that the PhD student has. There appears to be zero structure in place for holding a mentor accountable for their training quality and no structure in place to tell them what good management of a student or postdoc needs to look like. Much like anything, if there's no accountability or set of benchmarks and standards for a manager, the manager will not self-manage and improve and may take advantage of trainees. This review system should take special note to look out for the experience of minorities and especially persons on visas that are particularly vulnerable in academia.

Set expectations.

So we could set our own rules in our student-supervisor relationship. I think this helped us have a smooth 4 years PhD project.

You will need to accept that you are a limited person like any other and accept to be checked, accept to receive feedbacks and suggestions on what has to be improved and how it must be improved.<br /><br />You need to make this move!

He only has to be less serious. The fact is that, he is really good at what he is doing, but many students always asked me how I manage to work with him. As a mathematician in an economic department, many people would like to have him as a mentor/supervisor but they are some how to afraid of him. I myself went to him because I had a graduate degree in maths and I was pretty much looking for a mentor that can speak maths. Otherwise I am not sure I would have worked with him. I discover who he really was only when I went close to him. I still miss our weekly meeting :(

Be kind. Give a dog a bone from time to time - if you have a criticism, or perhaps a view of how something could be done better, offer a way forward rather than letting you student flounder.

### Mentees advise future mentees

In this section you will find the words of ECRs to describe what advice they would have given to those who are getting ready to pursue a career in science and are looking for mentors.

<blockquote>
Find a mentor who does not feel you being judged for what you don't know and helps you to become an independant scientist
<div class="blockquote-author"><b>Grad student</b> (♀) had a <span style="color:green;">very positive experience</span> in <b>Canada</b><br />shares <b>their advice</b> for future mentees</div>

Look for someone that is willing to support you no matter what choices you make for your career.
<div class="blockquote-author"><b>Grad student</b> (♂) had a <span style="color:green;">very positive experience</span> in <b>Canada</b><br />shares <b>their advice</b> for future mentees</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Look for people who care about others as whole persons, and not just what they produce. Look for those who show empathy to others, and those that aim to lift others up, rather than comparing people to others.
<div class="blockquote-author"><b>Postdoc</b> (♀) had a <span style="color:red;">very negative experience</span> in <b>United States</b><br />shares <b>their advice</b> for future mentees</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Find someone you have good rapport with. Pick a dynamic group that is well funded and the PI is passionate Find a location you like- outside of work. There is more to wellbeing in science than just the academic side.
<div class="blockquote-author"><b>Postdoc</b> (♂) had a <span style="color:green;">very positive experience</span> in <b>United Kingdom</b><br />shares <b>their advice</b> for future mentees</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
Make sure you talk to the other graduate students / trainees in a lab group (individually, one on one) and ask them whether or not they are happy with the mentorship that their mentor is providing, and whether they are happy overall with their experience in graduate school under that supervisor. I personally had a great mentorship and graduate school experience, but I've seen some very unhappy graduate students who entered labs without realizing how bad the mentorship was, because they did not ask these kinds of questions to current students.

Choose a field/career path you are passionate about but keep in mind there are considerate scientists in your field that exist that may not be a “big name.”
<div class="blockquote-author"><b>Postdoc</b> (♀) had a <span style="color:red;">very negative experience</span> in <b>United States</b><br />shares <b>their advice</b> for future mentees</div>

Ask their people direct questions and listen to the answers. Make sure that the mentor in question can work with people for long periods of time.

Ask people in the lab you are considering about their relationship with their mentor and if people warn you a certain PI is not a good choice - trust them. Don't think you will be the one who manages to enjoy a horrible lab.

<blockquote>
Ask potential mentors about their expectations for you / make your expectations of them clear. Talk ahead of time about how often you will meet, how involved the mentor will be in your project, how they approach the writing process. How does the mentor support the work-life balance decisions of their mentees?

Make sure you speak to current or past students of the potential mentors. This can reveal a lot more to you than speaking directly with the mentor.

look for your broad interest, select people with great career trainee output and consistent good papers by many different first authors, look geographically- do not want to live in a shitty place for 5 years
<div class="blockquote-author"><b>Postdoc</b> (♂) had a <span style="color:green;">positive experience</span> in <b>United States</b><br />shares <b>their advice</b> for future mentees</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
No one mentor will fill all your needs. Look for places where there will be several people you can work with who can offer different things. Be open about this. If a prospective mentor does not want you to also go to others for help and expertise this is a RED FLAG. Make sure you will not be isolated if your first job/lab does not work out (this can happen even with the best intentions on both sides). Make sure you will not be isolated from peers with similar professional/personal goals and experiences. Having a community, whatever that means to you is extremely important. Grad school and research are HARD, do not make it harder for yourself by trying to do it in a place where you are unhappy for professional or personal reasons.

I would strongly encourage them to talk with members who have left the lab to get their perspectives on the mentor. It seems those currently in the lab are rarely willing to provide honest feedback, and maybe do not have time to really reflect on the impact of their advisors mentorship till after they have left the lab and had a bit of mental space.

<blockquote>
Find mentors outside of your program and outside of your school. Academia is small and runs on gossip. You won't know who is married to each other. Get more than one. Ask for help from them to build your network. Find science twitter and connect with folks there by asking questions. This is really helpful of you are a minority or URM or first gen - you can find mentors who understand what you're going through. Folks like these may not be available at your university and it's essential to have people who have the shorthand.

<blockquote>
This is key point. Research your mentor. Find a contact to someone who worked with them and ask, have a normal chat how he/she is. Do not treat this as a minor problem. If ignored or badly choosen it can kill your spirit/passion and made you feel very bad for years of collaboration.

<blockquote>
You want someone productive and supportive. Look at their publication records and check where the people who used to be in their lab are now, are they still in academia? Are they independent researchers?<br /><br />A mentor might look great on paper, but always try to speak to people from their research group. Look at their body language, they will never say bad things about their boss but their body language shows how they really feel - I know I visibly stiffen whenever am asked about my experience.
<div class="blockquote-author"><b>Grad student</b> (♀) had a <span style="color:red;">very negative experience</span> in <b>United Kingdom</b><br />shares <b>their advice</b> for future mentees</div>
</blockquote>

Ask members of the prospective work place about their experiences when your future mentor is not present.<br /><br />If you are going for a Ph.D. position, check how long it takes on average for a student to receive his degree at this place and do not assume that you can do it faster if joining that team.<br /><br />It is more important to join a supporting environment than a top level department.

This is a very difficult question, everyone I asked beforehand had a completely different answer, because every relationship is different with their own difficulties. For me personally, I would say, try to find out the expectations of your mentor early on, and decide if they meet what you want from your work. Possibly the interview stage is not the best time, but once you have started. And don't be afraid to leave if things turn out to be different than you thought.

If you want to engage in the preparation of a PhD thesis with a mentor, it's better knowing them before (e.g., do a 2-6 months internship in their lab beforehand).

Pick your mentor really carefully, and maybe ask them what their style is, i.e. how much input and feedback they give to their PhD students. If you're someone who is fine working mostly on your own, then you also need a mentor who leaves you a lot of room to do the things you want to do. In the same way, if you're someone who needs more feedback and direction, you may need someone who meets a lot with you and who is open to discussing struggles. If something feels weird about your potential mentor during the interview, don't just ignore it but really think about if this is a person that you want to be around and answer to for the next years. Don't just pick a project because of the institute or the topic per se like I did :P

I.e. is there a system in place to check on your progress and advocate on your behalf? Our department instituted a “mentor” program where grad students got paired up with a faculty member outside of their committee, someone who wasn’t their main advisor. This persons sole job is to check on your progress and intervene if you need assistance. I didn’t have this person until my 5th year of grad school, so I didn’t get help u tip my 5th year to move forward. It shouldn’t be on my to advocate 100% for myself. I’ve never been a grad student before. I don’t know what is and isn’t supposed to happen.

Pay close attention to how mentees talk about their mentor, especially casually. The most important things are you have a supportive advisor who is present for you and who does not abuse their mentees. Abuse in science is so common that it's normalized, and mentees will often not recognize and name their experiences as abuse, so don't expect someone to fully tell you that so-and-so is abusive.

Choose a mentor you can openly talk to and doesn't see you just as labor. I got very lucky with my mentor as I realized this during my rotations. As I look at my peers though, so many professors, typically earlier in their career, see their students as labor producers as a means for their own career. The system encourages this with the pressure that's placed on young investigators and anybody choosing to work with such a person should know this going in.

Pick a mentor who you trust (in terms of both scientific rigor and having your best interest at heart) and one you can communicate with most ease including both positive and negative feedback. Pick a mentor who is available.

Your boss shouldn't be your *only* mentor. Also, especially if you plan to roughly stay in the same field long term, the people you meet randomly during your first year of your PhD could still be your colleagues 10 years later. So, generally keep that in mind from a professionalism perspective and in terms of effort to be cordial, etc! :)

First, you want to avoid total assholes. Try and talk to other trainees in the lab. Talk with the mentor and see if you like them as a person. If you can get along with the mentor, then the next concern is how cool their science is. But there's no such thing as the perfect mentor, so it's just as important to learn from a mentor what *not* to do. The weaknesses of your mentors are just as valuable as their strengths, as they help you to define your own style. And it doesn't stop there. No one ever ends up as a perfect mentor, and your own faults will end up being helpful/educational to your trainees (whether you are aware of them or not). At the same time, it's great if we can get feedback from trainees to try and improve ourselves continually (but it's often hard to get that kind of frank feedback from trainees).

If your prospective mentor has previous mentees, talk with them! After a negative experience with a former adviser, I treated interviewing the mentees of faculty I was considering working with as a game of getting them to disclose the worst aspects of their mentor. 'What would you say are the primary goals of X when it comes to their students - publishing quickly?', 'When you contact X with a question or send material for feedback, how long is it normally before you hear back from them? What aspects of your work does X normally focus on for feedback?' 'Has X ever said anything that made you uncomfortable?', 'Does X show a preference for having mentorship interactions with some students over others?' If there are actually uncomfortable answers to these sorts of questions, mentees will usually hem and haw. If, on the other hand, you've found a stellar mentor, students will usually be able to deny the impression given by these sorts of questions and elaborate on some good qualities of their mentor. Asking a question that expects a positive response ('Do you enjoy working here?') makes it seem like all you are looking for a is a 'Yup!' before deciding to work there, and many people are happy to oblige.

Ask lab personnel what it's like (but even then you may not always get the truth). So also ask other peers in the field who know the potential mentor. Ask the mentor and the lab personnel how many students and/or postdocs have left their lab prior to finishing, and then check to see that the answers match between mentor and mentee. If the mentor says "Well, I had 1 postdoc leave but he was crazy" that should be a red flag. Is the postdoc crazy or is the mentor crazy? Lastly, as much as you may want the job, nothing is more important than your own physical/emotional/mental well-being. It is simply not worth it to work for a jerk. And it is much easier to choose not to work for them than to leave their lab after you are already working for them. So, do your research and make sure you and joining a lab with a mentor that is mentally and emotionally stable.

It's all in the mix! There are different kinds of mentors and each can be helpful in their individual way. Some are very good at providing guidance for the day-to-day questions and problems, these mentors are ideally physically close, e.g., at the same department. Some are good at networking, putting the word out, or write exceptional recommendation letters, or help with your career vision. The latter do not need to be around often to still make a huge impact. No single person has answers to all your questions, and sometimes a second opinion is helpful too, so it is good to have several mentors.

A lot of folks recommend thinking about how hands off vs. hands on a mentor you want. But if you're opting for more hands off, what kinds of options do you want/need for times when you do need a little more interaction and help? How important is it that your existing research interests match your mentor's vs. other kinds of compatibility? What kinds of future paths are you considering, and what experience does your mentor have in advising folks on those paths? What are your strengths, and what are skills you want to work on? What skills do potential mentors think are important, and how do they help trainees develop those skills?

This is hard because is a box of surprises, everybody is cool, gentile and happy when are they recruiting. A good advice could be to talk with current or past trainees of the professor you have in mind.<br /><br />Enter a laboratory that is ideal for you and with a subject that you are passionate about, it is already difficult enough to do it with an assigned subject.<br /><br />Have confidence to speak, especially if you feel trampled (there is some reason), stop looking professors as demigods, they are just people and remember you have a University, center, institution who should help you and look out for you, even against a bully advisor (at least you will be able to find one person to lend you a hand).<br /><br />My personal experience here in Chile was quite different from the one the nationals of this country have, it might be cultural. In Venezuela I studied in a big public University, in Chile the Universities are very different, very based on hierarchy, so here they are not used to argue or contradict a professor or even discuss, even the feel somewhat attacked. But I was very clear in my mind that we needed to come to terms and been able to discuss, not just fall in line as I was supposed to.<br /><br />To sum up, I guess that the best advice I could give would be: stop believing and feeling like your advisor is doing you a favor.

Choose mentors who can guide you.<br /><br />Don't select them based on the papers how much they have published.

If they have their best intentions for you, your career and your working relationship they will make the time for it and be clear to each other on your working expectations (do they want you to be semi-independent? what working hours do you each expect? etc )<br /><br />Also never rely on one person for the success of your degree/paper/career. If you think something is a red flag it probably is and be sure not to bottle it up. Academia is a cruel place where kindness rarely pays off and a culture of silence is often expected.<br /><br />Make sure you have done your research; check your mentors group dynamics (ask to join a group meeting if possible), talk to colleagues, check authorships and lists (is there a bias?

Figure out what mentoring style works best for you, and try to choose your advisor(s) based on the maximum extent of this complementarity. This is a hard task, and granted most incoming graduate students don't yet know what style works best for them. Each person is different, and therefore we should expect that mentoring styles that work for one person may not work for another. Graduate students should invest time to research the prospective lab's culture, talk to alumni of that lab, assess their own fit within that lab's culture, and determine to the best of their ability whether that would be a good fit for them. This set of criteria is far more important than joining the lab with the most CNS papers or the lab with the "coolest" PI.

Firstly, I would ask them, are they sure they want to go into science. It is a toxic working place with people who have been given a lot of power without any checks.

Be friendly, organized and concise and please do not pressure anyone into being your mentor - reminders are fine!<br /><br />Have a clear idea of what you need from the relationship, even if it is "I have no idea what this field is, please teach me" Find mentors for all stages and skills - professional, scientific and life - that you feel comfortable talking frankly with. This will keep you sane when things are rough.

They should look for a mentor who have papers on the particular topic they want to study. In addition to that, I believe working with a younger mentor would have its own advantages such as the thirst for the new ideas.

If you really like research, the institutional rankings do not matter, choose the mentor or group that can nurture your mental well being, not those who care for outputs.

Talk to all members of the research group. Particularly, reach out to past member and ask them about their experience: they have nothing to fear and are likely to be more honest.

Always have an open and honest conversation with a mentor from the start (even before application). The more honest you can be the better trust you will get and the better you will be supported to your needs.

Pick someone who genuinely seems to think highly of you and respect you. It wears you down to feel looked down upon in the long run, even if no disrespect is openly expressed.

Find one who is flexible and understanding in terms of scheduling. As long as the work is done, the time you do it doesn't matter to them. Also find one who is engaged and willing to meet with you at least weekly to help keep you focused and on track.

Science is generally an unstable high stress career at PhD level. Sincerely ask whether you want that or if a ms level position meets your needs. Look for mentors who have experience in a variety of industries to help w job placement

I would say you should find an advisor who fits your goals well. If you’re trying to do good science while staying mentally and physically healthy, you should find an advisor who values that. Make sure to ask questions that prove their work-life balance and priorities. The mentor-mentee relationship will make or break your graduate school experience and beyond.

Mentor fit can be very specific, but the best mentors will also be flexible and adaptable. Try to understand what kind of support you need, and talk to many people about what kind of support helped them succeed. Ask for what you need and if your current mentor can’t give that help, find another who can.

If something doesn’t feel right, keep looking for someone you can trust to bring this up. I dealt with sexual harassment for years before I was able to get it addressed properly. It shouldn’t be this way and now is the time to act for change - but the people who will help you can’t help you if they don’t know what is happening.

When something doesn’t feel right find someone you can trust to bring the issue up with. Keep looking for this someone if you don’t find them right away - they are there and they will help. They can’t if they don’t know there is a problem.

Your mentor can make a huge difference on your quality of life. I’d recommend finding someone who nurtures a supportive lab environment. Talking to other members of the lab can be a good way to learn about mentorship style and the overall lab culture.

<blockquote>
Your advisor will probably not be the person helping you learn techniques or do analyses- look for a cohesive and supportive lab environment for that. Esp: look for high postdoc/scientist to student ratio, or formal senior student mentoring (look for coauthorships with first/second year students). For your advisor, what matters most is their availability (will they have time to remember you exist? Ask students this not them) what matters second is their network (are they well respected and well liked? Do they take their students to conferences every year?). And, they will tell you about their most successful students. Ask explicitly about who took longest and why, did anyone drop out or change advisor and why.

Even if you think you know someone through collaboration, get outside opinions from previous/current mentees to make sure your mentor is a good fit for you.

Always try to know what the mentor's requirement from the ECR and do a research not only on what they publish in academia but also about their general behaviour with lab members and workimg style bceause you should be able to match with that otherwise that might be a reason for stress and then work gets affected. Talk to people who are laready working in their labs to know more about them.
