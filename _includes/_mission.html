<p>We strive to <a href="{{ site.url }}/software/">create</a> advanced software platforms and design experiments to <a href="{{ site.url }}/publications/">contribute</a> to a wide range of concurrent <a href="{{ site.url }}/research/">research questions</a> in the domain of microbial ecology.</p>

<p>Located at the <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a> <a href="http://medicine.uchicago.edu/">Department of Medicine</a> and affiliated with the
<a href="http://mbl.edu">Marine Biological Laboratory</a>, we are constantly looking for collaborations that would challenge us with novel and intriguing questions.</p>
