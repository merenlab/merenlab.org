10.1101/129791	Novel nitrogen-fixing populations.; Nearly 1,000 non-redundant and high-quality bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic population genomes from TARA Oceans metagenomes.; Extensive description of <a href="http://merenlab.org/data/2017_Delmont_et_al_HBDs/" target="_blank">bioinformatics approaches</a>.	http://i.imgur.com/oFRefc4.jpg
10.7717/peerj.1319	The methods paper for <a href="http://merenlab.org/software/anvio/" target="_blank">anvi'o</a>.; Binning, and single-nucleotide variant analysis of a human gut time series metagenome.; Re-analysis of cultivar genomes, metagenomes, and metatranscriptomes associated with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.	http://i.imgur.com/d1c7bUY.png
10.1186/s40168-017-0270-x	An FMT study with metagenome-assembled genomes (see <a href="http://merenlab.org/data/#lee-et-al-2017" target="_blank">public data</a>).;Bacteroidales: high-colonization rate. Clostridiales: low colonization rate. Colonization success is negatively correlated with the number of genes related to sporulation.; MAGs with the same taxonomy showed different colonization properties, highlighting the importance of high-resolution analyses.; Populations colonized both recipients were also prevalent in the HMP cohort (and the ones that did not, distribute sporadically across the HMP cohort).	http://i.imgur.com/4e4Ic4u.jpg
10.3389/fmicb.2015.00358	 Application of <i>in situ</i> enrichments to shape the diversity of complex metagenomes prior to sequencing.; The first successful attempt to assemble multiple near-complete bacterial genomes directly from a soil sample.; The abundance of reconstructed genomes ranged from rare (<0.0001%) to relatively abundant (>0.01%) in pristine soil metagenomes.	../images/pubs/delmont_rare_soil_genomes.png
10.7717/peerj.1839	A holistic approach to visualize and curate genomic and metagenomic assemblies.;A re-analysis of the first released Tardigrade genome reveals a likely symbiont among other contaminants.; A practical approach to estimate the number bacterial genomes in an assembly.	../images/pubs/delmont_tardigrade.png
