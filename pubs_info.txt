10.1186/s40168-017-0270-x	An FMT study with metagenome-assembled genomes (see <a href="http://merenlab.org/data/#lee-et-al-2017--fecal-transplants" target="_blank">public data</a>).;Bacteroidales: high-colonization rate. Clostridiales: low colonization rate. Colonization success is negatively correlated with the number of genes related to sporulation.; MAGs with the same taxonomy showed different colonization properties, highlighting the importance of high-resolution analyses.; Populations colonized both recipients were also prevalent in the HMP cohort (and the ones that did not, distribute sporadically across the HMP cohort).	http://i.imgur.com/4e4Ic4u.jpg
